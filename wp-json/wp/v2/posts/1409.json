The modding community doesn&#8217;t think about dedicating itself to another game either, and is tackling the most diverse aspects of the sandbox: from new skins and interface improvements to entire content packages and complex physics effects, they leave no stone untouched. <\/p>\n<p>These mods are essentially files that you download and add to your game, with some being easier to install than others.  To save you a lot of searching and tinkering, you can use curated Minecraft mod packs.  This means you don&#8217;t have to install each mod individually and you can also be sure that the different mods also harmonize with each other.  That is not always the case.  For this reason, you should always make a note of which additional files are slumbering on your hard drive so that you know where the problem might lie, just in case.  We can tell you from our own experience that otherwise it is damn tricky to localize the source of the error.  Also, always take a closer look at the source of your Minecraft mod, as there are viruses and malware slingers to be found here (as everywhere else on the internet). <\/p>\n<p>Things are a little different on consoles, of course.  You can&#8217;t catch any viruses here and you don&#8217;t have to expect incompatibility between individual mods.  But the offer is also significantly smaller &#8211; and in most cases not even free of charge.  Rather, you have to search the stores of your respective Daddelkiste for extensions and add-ons, for which a small amount is due in most cases.  Basically, these are less mods than additional content professionally programmed by the developers.  Unfortunately, there will never be a mod variety on consoles like on the PC. <\/p>\n<p>There is by no means a lack of high-quality Minecraft mods, but there is a lack of an overview.  But that&#8217;s what this article is for.<\/p>\n<h2>The best Minecraft mods to download<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve finally left the gray theory behind us and you know how to install mods, all you have to do is decide which ones are eligible.  Therefore, below you will find a selection of the most useful, the prettiest and generally those modifications that you should have tried out.  Have fun with it. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Hyper HD Realism<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>A look at the screenshot below should actually be reason enough to give the skiddion mod a chance.  Hyper HD Realism is, as the name implies, a texture pack that really revs up the graphics of the old brick adventure.  The lighting looks beautiful, as does the water.  A must-have for any of you interested in graphical improvements. <\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"content_image\" height=\"342\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655833972_809_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png\"  width=\"608\"\/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Journey map<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Like many of the mods listed here, Journey Map has been available for some time and is constantly being improved.  It allows you to track your progress on a useful grid map.  As you explore, you&#8217;ll have access to an additional minimap, as well as a detailed map noting points of interest.  This makes exploring the game world much easier.  In addition, Journey Map is extremely well optimized and extremely stable.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"content_image\" height=\"520\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655833973_968_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png\"  width=\"690\"\/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Terra Firm Craft<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Terra Firma Craft says it&#8217;s making Minecraft the &#8220;survival adventure it was always meant to be.&#8221;  However, behind this confident claim there is a lot of truth and a far more intense gaming experience.  You fight your way through the stone, cast iron and iron epochs one after the other, gradually getting better equipment at your disposal.  If you have to make do with primitive tools at the beginning and do unexciting things with them (there are more than enough trees to cut down), you can get everything out of the powerful forging system in the Iron Age. <\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"content_image\" height=\"387\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655833973_336_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png\"  width=\"690\"\/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Visible armor slots<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some of the best Minecraft mods deal with seemingly small quality-of-life improvements.  Their effects are often huge and can make your everyday life much more comfortable thanks to numerous comfort functions.  Visible Armor Slots is a perfect example of such an unassuming mod with great utility.  This adds a custom armor tab to many menus, so you don&#8217;t have to constantly switch between menus.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"content_image\" height=\"383\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655833973_637_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png\"  width=\"690\"\/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Pam&#8217;s Harvest Craft<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With the installation of this mod you spice up the food selection in Minecraft.  Since the original release, over 275 treats and recipes have been added, including crops to harvest and transplant, fruit trees and more.  You can also craft cooking items and use them to conjure up tasty dishes from the fresh ingredients. <\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"content_image\" height=\"544\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.jpg\"  width=\"689\"\/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Tough as Nails<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For the hardcore gamers among you.  Tough as Nails adds a hunger, thirst, and body temperature mechanic to the main game.  You have to keep a constant eye on each of them, which makes Minecraft almost a survival game.  Here your systemic skills and the efficient use of the inventory will be put to the test.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"content_image\" height=\"388\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655833974_623_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png\"  width=\"690\"\/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Just Enough Information<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Just Enough Information is a kind of in-game reference book that you can browse through at any time to find out what materials you need for a crafting recipe.  This saves an enormous amount of time and makes it easier to plan long-term what to keep an eye out for on your next foray into the world. <\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"content_image\" height=\"391\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655833974_59_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png\"  width=\"690\"\/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hooked<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s cooler than a grappling hook?  Hooked adds just one to Minecraft, with the help of which you can move much faster and experience a whole new level of agility.  The mod itself is extremely small, but its implications for gameplay are enormous.  A must-download for everyone who is fed up with struggling to climb mountains and similar structures.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"content_image\" height=\"388\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655833974_151_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png\"  width=\"690\"\/><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Aether II<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The sequel to the popular Aether mod continues what the prequel started and throws you into a &#8220;hostile paradise in the middle of the clouds&#8221;.  You get a fascinating world, mythical creatures, mysterious buildings and impressive landscapes.  It&#8217;s worth it.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Aether II - Highlands: Intro preview\" width=\"1140\" height=\"641\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XmSj9xFkqug?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><br \/>\n<\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Rocketry<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A later compensation for the missed childhood dream of becoming an astronaut: With Advanced Rocketry you can craft space shuttles and (much cooler) even launch them.  You even have the opportunity to develop your own space program, build space stations and explore space.  An adorably imaginative mod that literally takes Minecraft to new heights. <\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"content_image\" height=\"365\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655833975_39_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png\"  width=\"690\"\/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Quark<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a strange, offbeat gaming experience, there are more than enough mods out there that really go against the grain of Minecraft.  Quark is also keen to give you a huge variety, while staying as close to the original vanilla experience as possible.  The devil is in the details: Quark offers you things like wooden chests, ship sails and everything in between.  The modification adds a whole new level of detail to almost every aspect, which subtly expands the existing possibilities of the main game many times over. <\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"content_image\" height=\"365\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655833975_927_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png\"  width=\"690\"\/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Chisel and Bits<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Minecraft&#8217;s blocky look may have originally been born out of pragmatic necessity, but it now accounts for a not inconsiderable iconic charm of the game.  Even so, a world thrown together from blocks can quickly seem a bit uniform.  This is where Chisel and Bits comes in, a mod that allows you to create much more detailed blocks using different chisels.  You have various tools at your disposal to give the architect in you a little outlet. <\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"content_image\" height=\"453\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655833975_539_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png\"  width=\"690\"\/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Cooking for Blockheads<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cooking is a hell of a lot of fun in Minecraft, even if you&#8217;re constantly chasing missing ingredients.  Cooking for Blockheads tightens the entire mechanics properly, adding a cookbook to the game that only shows recipes whose ingredients you currently have available.  The mod is a great complement to Pam&#8217;s Harvest Craft and greatly expands the way you use food in the game.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"content_image\" height=\"380\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655833975_307_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png\"  width=\"690\"\/><\/p>\n<p><strong>animania<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Animania adds a far greater variety of animals to Minecraft.  You will find more breeds, genders, behaviors and of course new species here.  If you feed your pets regularly, they will give you some resources as a thank you.  However, this is not quite as easy as it may sound at first, since every four-legged friend has its own personality. <\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Animania Mod Spotlight #1\" width=\"1140\" height=\"641\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/lx9HT7688xE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><br \/>\n<\/iframe><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"\/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are there mods for PS4, Switch and Xbox One?
