The two commonly played editions of Minecraft are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Java edition<\/li>\n<li>Bedrock edition<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If this is your first time hearing them, here is a detailed description of each of them \u2013<\/p>\n<p><strong>Minecraft Java Edition <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Java Edition is the oldest of any game type ever to appear in Minecraft and is still available for Windows, macOS, or Linux.  Installing this edition will give you better graphics, more servers and unlimited modding possibilities.
