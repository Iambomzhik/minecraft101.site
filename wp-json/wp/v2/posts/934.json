In an interview with the English-language magazine mcvnordic.com, he said they were looking into installing their own servers for the build-up game and making them available to the players for a fee.  One wants to generate income through Minecraft in the long term, so Manneh.  After all, users would only pay for the game once, but would receive all subsequent content free of charge.  These statements raised the fear among many supporters that Minecraft could only be playable by paying a certain monthly fee.<\/p>\n<p>However, this has now been denied by Minecraft chief developer Jens Bergensten.  On the Twitter news portal, a user asked whether it was true that in the future every player would have to pay money for Minecraft&#8217;s multiplayer mode.  The developer&#8217;s response was &#8220;No, it&#8217;s not.&#8221;  In principle, however, it remains conceivable that Mojang will offer paid and managed servers in the future, but that these will be usable voluntarily.
