Indeed, if you give me a few minutes of your precious time, I can provide you with all the information you need.  However, let&#8217;s make one point right away: download Minecraft for free from the App Store, unless certain promotions are being run.  it is practically impossible.  Of course, there are alternative methods that border on legality, but as you can easily guess, I won&#8217;t tell you about them in my post.

Finally I will tell you how to play Minecraft for free via PC or game console.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"57\" data-c=\"306\">So tell me: Are you really ready to deal with the topic?

I sincerely hope that in the end you can feel very happy and satisfied with what you have learned.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"ah\" data-w=\"1\" data-c=\"307\"\/>\n<ul class=\"ah\" data-w=\"35\" data-c=\"342\">\n<li>Download Minecraft for iPhone<\/li>\n<li>Free alternatives to Minecraft\n<ul>\n<li>Block Craft 3D<\/li>\n<li>Multicraft<\/li>\n<li>The fools<\/li>\n<li>World of Cubes Survival Craft<\/li>\n<li>Edition Taschenweltcraft<\/li>\n<li>Minecraft: Story Mode<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Minecraft on PC and other platforms and game tips<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 class=\"ah\" data-w=\"4\" data-c=\"346\">Download Minecraft for iPhone<\/h2>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"59\" data-c=\"405\">Since, as already mentioned, it is not possible to download the original version of Minecraft for free on iPhone, since it is a paid game, the cost of which is the same <strong>7.99 euros<\/strong> However, as initially expected, we tried to understand how to buy and download it from the App Store.  That way, if you need to think again, you&#8217;ll still know how to proceed.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"73\" data-c=\"478\">To download Minecraft on your iPhone, the first thing you have to do is grab the device and access the home screen (the screen where we have all the applications installed in iOS) and touch the &#8216; <strong>AppStore<\/strong> (the one who has <strong>the letter &#8220;A&#8221; in the middle and the light blue background<\/strong> ), the official app store that is present on devices running on the OS Cupertino Enterprise Mobile.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"77\" data-c=\"555\">Once the App Store main screen appears, press the icon <strong>Seek<\/strong>Enter the term at the bottom right <strong>Minecraft<\/strong> In the search box at the top, click and then press the button <strong>Seek<\/strong> attached to keyboard virtual.  At this point, select the appropriate search result from the list of games and applications presented to you and stop on the button with the words <strong>7.99 euros<\/strong> and confirm your willingness to continue purchasing the game.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"92\" data-c=\"647\">Finally, enter your Apple ID password or place your finger on the Touch ID sensor (if your device supports it) or use Face ID again (if you have an iPhone X) to start the download process .  If you want, you can speed up the execution of all these steps by connecting directly to the section of the App Store dedicated to this topic <strong>Minecraft<\/strong> Tap here from your iPhone.  Have you ever bought digital content from your iPhone?  Then I suggest you read my guide to purchasing from the App Store.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"44\" data-c=\"691\">Once the whole process of downloading and installing the game is complete, press the button <strong>Open<\/strong>to enjoy Minecraft instantly on your iDevice.  Alternatively, you can launch the game by clicking on its icon added to the iPhone home screen.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ah\" data-w=\"32\" data-c=\"723\">Finally, I would like to point out that in addition to downloading the game, it also comes with some additional (non-mandatory) content that can be unlocked through in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"37\" data-c=\"760\">If desired, skins, textures and game worlds can be purchased.  To do this, simply access the section <strong>online shop<\/strong> of the game, present on the main Minecraft screen.  However, along with the extra stuff, there is also free content available.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"37\" data-c=\"797\">In all cases, an account is required to download them. <strong>Microsoft<\/strong> &#8211; If you don&#8217;t have one and you don&#8217;t know how to create one, you can read my tutorial on the subject to know how to do it.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"ah\" data-w=\"4\" data-c=\"801\">Free alternatives to Minecraft<\/h2>\n<p class=\"ah\" data-w=\"55\" data-c=\"856\">Since, as already mentioned in the previous paragraphs, it is currently not possible to download Minecraft for iPhone for free, you can resort to valid alternatives that are completely free (or if you do not intend to spend money to buy the iDevice version of the famous game in any case both for free) and it&#8217;s worth trying at least once.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ah\" data-w=\"45\" data-c=\"901\">Just as alternatives, these may not return to the original game in every way, and may have flaws and\/or imperfections compared to the latter.  If you don&#8217;t pay special attention to them, they can still be great solutions.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ah\" data-w=\"28\" data-c=\"929\">So below are the Minecraft games \u00abin sauce\u00bb that I think you should try on your iPhone if you&#8217;re looking for something similar to the famous title.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"ah\" data-w=\"3\" data-c=\"932\">Block Craft 3D<\/h3>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"65\" data-c=\"997\">The first of the free alternatives to Minecraft that you will consider is <strong> Block Craft 3D<\/strong>.  It&#8217;s a beautiful clone of Free Minecraft which is therefore free to download and play.  There is also optional paid content (such as gems or the ability to fly your character) that you can unlock through in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ah\" data-w=\"39\" data-c=\"1036\">The goal of the game is to construct different objects and buildings to bring your village to life and develop it as much as possible.  The graphics fully reflect Minecraft: they are three-dimensional, &#8220;square&#8221; and smooth enough.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"ah\" data-w=\"1\" data-c=\"1037\">Multicraft<\/h3>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"64\" data-c=\"1101\">Another free game that you can download as an alternative to &#8220;real&#8221; Minecraft is <strong>Multicraft<\/strong>.  It includes the graphics and dynamics of the Microsoft and Mojang titles.  You can choose to play in creative mode, play the role of a builder, or play in survival mode instead of disguising yourself as a ruthless hunter who must do whatever it takes to survive.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ah\" data-w=\"43\" data-c=\"1144\">For the rest, the game has nothing to envy to the original, if not the presence of advertising content, perhaps a little excessive.  Given that it&#8217;s a completely free title (there aren&#8217;t even any in-app purchases), it&#8217;s definitely worth trying.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"ah\" data-w=\"2\" data-c=\"1146\">The fools<\/h3>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"60\" data-c=\"1206\">Another free alternative Minecraft game that I would like to recommend you is <strong>The fools<\/strong>.  The title is a kind of hybrid between the Mojang title and Terraria, another very famous open world game in which you have to explore the environment, build objects and protect yourself from enemies.  In this case, too, free mechanics are available with optional in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ah\" data-w=\"23\" data-c=\"1229\">The graphics, on the other hand, are almost identical to those of Minecraft, but the view is in 2D, therefore horizontal scrolling only and exclusively.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"ah\" data-w=\"5\" data-c=\"1234\">World of Cubes Survival Craft<\/h3>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"45\" data-c=\"1279\">The graphics are a bit more modern than the classic Minecraft, but <strong>World of Cubes Survival Art<\/strong> However, it manages to establish itself as a valid free alternative to the latter (but with in-app purchases to unlock additional content), also because the gameplay is practically the same.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"46\" data-c=\"1325\">In fact, you can create custom worlds and access the multiplayer mode, have fun with other random online users or with friends.  You can then explore universes and worlds created by others, search for your own maps, and more.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ah\" data-w=\"35\" data-c=\"1360\">Also note the ability to customize your character by choosing from over 100 different skins organized by theme.  The same goes for textures: you can choose the one you prefer from the different packs available.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"ah\" data-w=\"3\" data-c=\"1363\">Worldcraft Pocket Edition<\/h3>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"49\" data-c=\"1412\"><strong>Worldcraft Pocket Edition<\/strong> is another sandbox game that picks up on the glory of Minecraft.  It allows you to play in creative or survival mode and offers everything, good or bad, found in the original version of the game, so to speak.  The graphics are also practically flawless.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"53\" data-c=\"1465\">The only real downsides are the fact that the game suffers from some lag and annoying ads appear from time to time, which can still be removed through in-app purchases.  In fact, since it&#8217;s a free alternative to Minecraft, it&#8217;s certainly interesting.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"ah\" data-w=\"3\" data-c=\"1468\">Minecraft: Story Mode<\/h3>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"71\" data-c=\"1539\">Finally, I would like to inform you <strong>Minecraft: Story Mode<\/strong>.  The game contains the incredible and fantastic universe of the Microsoft and Mojang title and contains all the elements of the classic sandbox.  However, it differs from the latter by having a pre-made adventure that changes according to the choices made throughout the story.  Therefore, the settings are those of classic Minecraft, but the dynamics are very different.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"35\" data-c=\"1574\">The title was developed by the famous software house Telltale Games, which is probably best known for The Walking Dead, Tales from the Borderlands and Wolf Among Us or Game of Thrones.  Includes free game mechanics.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"ah\" data-w=\"8\" data-c=\"1582\">Minecraft on other platforms and game tips<\/h2>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"72\" data-c=\"1654\">Now that you finally have clear ideas on how to download Minecraft for iPhone for free (or rather, the available alternatives), I would like to draw your attention to the completeness of information available not only for PC and iOS, but also for the famous creation game usable.  in Android, Windows Mobile, on various consoles and on Apple TV.  In any case, the game is paid, but a free demo version is also available for the PC.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ah\" data-w=\"44\" data-c=\"1698\">For more details and to know what you should do to download \/ buy the game on PC and other devices, I recommend you to read my article on downloading Minecraft, where I talked to you in detail about the matter have.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block ah\" data-w=\"57\" data-c=\"1755\">If you want a completely free solution, we encourage you to try it <strong>Classic Minecraft<\/strong>, a version of this famous video game that can be used through a web browser.  However, I warn you that Minecraft Classic is one of the first versions of Minecraft to be released (it dates back to 2009) and therefore does not reflect the gaming experience on offer.  of the latest editions.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ah\" data-w=\"45\" data-c=\"1800\">However, it can be a valid free alternative, considering that it&#8217;s also official, with which you can also destroy and build the Minecraft world together with your friends (up to nine).  I have told you in detail how to get Minecraft for free in my guide.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ah\" data-w=\"56\" data-c=\"1856\">And if you want advice on how to play, you can read my post on how to play Minecraft.
