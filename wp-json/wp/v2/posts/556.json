Anyone who is one of the more than 20 million Minecraft players worldwide and who installed the new Windows 10 OS with today&#8217;s launch can secure the right new app for the block adventure right away.  It brings some functions from other operating systems to the PC.  The Windows 10 Edition Beta is available completely free of charge after registering in the Mojang account and waiting a short time.<br \/>\nWindows 10 gets its own Minecraft<\/p>\n<h2>This is how you get the beta for Windows 10 for free<\/h2>\n<p>To do this, log into your Mojang account at account.mojang.com\/login using any web browser.  There you will also find the option to request the beta in your master data.  All necessary steps are shown.  You also need to authenticate with your Microsoft account to redeem a Windows 10 Edition Beta coupon code via Redeem.
