It is also one of the most downloaded resource packs across all platforms.  There are also reasons for the high number of users, because the pack is available for both the Java Edition and the Bedrock Edition.  This gives every Minecraft player the chance to play with it and start a new great adventure.  In addition, many German YouTubers such as Unspielen, Dner or Paluten have often played with it.  Of course, the fans also wanted to download PureBDcraft, which is why the number of downloads in Germany increased continuously. <\/p>\n<p>After installation, the first thing you see is the main menu, and there you can discover the first cool changes to the user interface.  On the one hand the font has been changed and on the other hand the appearance of the buttons.  On top of that, the background image has been swapped out and now looks much better.  In addition, the loading screen has been adjusted, which definitely makes you want more.  You&#8217;ll quickly notice that the entire game&#8217;s visuals have really been redesigned.<\/p>\n<p>Also, it&#8217;s interesting for you to know that everything is very cartoon-like.  You will definitely come to appreciate this style over time, as it makes the animals around you look much nicer, for example, and even hostile creatures don&#8217;t look scary.  Some of them have a random appearance so not every mob looks the same.<\/p>\n<h3>All resolutions available<\/h3>\n<p>Each block has been created with great attention to detail and all blocks together give a great overall picture.  Ultimately, it&#8217;s up to you to decide whether you&#8217;d rather have average or high-resolution textures.  Fortunately, PureBDcraft is available in every resolution, as you can already see from the info box at the top.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, there is a huge jump in quality between the lowest and highest versions.  The 128x package is a good guide as it&#8217;s right in the middle and works well for most computers.  If you notice that your PC is too bad and you get lags, then try a lower package.  If you get a lot of FPS you can do the exact opposite and choose a higher resolution.<\/p>\n<h3>Compatible with all versions and devices<\/h3>\n<p>In addition, the texture pack can be downloaded for each Minecraft version, as development already started with MC-Beta 1.6.  To give you an idea of \u200b\u200bhow long ago it was, that&#8217;s when the Nether first became functional for multiplayer.  As a result, it can be said that Sphax has been working on PureBDcraft since early 2011.  A lot of time has passed since then, but still every texture of an update is always exchanged for a new one.  Consequently, you will not find placeholder textures anywhere in your environment because everything is 100% complete.<\/p>\n<p>So far it has been about why the project is so popular.  Now we come to the devices with which you can use Sphax.  In principle, this can be answered quickly, because it can be used on all devices that support the Java Edition or Bedrock Edition.  This is possible because the BDcraft team is an official Minecraft partner and therefore offers their creations in the marketplace.  In general, all game consoles (e.g. PS4) and operating systems (e.g. Android) should be able to handle these cartoon textures.<\/p>\n<h3>Sphax PureBDcraft Texture Pack Addons<\/h3>\n<p>Usually, particularly successful texture packs have a lot of additional content that complements the base pack.  Sphax PureBDcraft also has a whole list of add-ons, all of which are free.  Take a close look at our compilation, because there might be something that you like.

In the next few lines you will find all the necessary steps you need to follow for a smooth installation.  Then you can enjoy completely new game graphics on your computer, which you will surely like.  In our tests, the instructions worked without any problems with Windows, Linux and macOS.<\/p>\n<p>1. When you come to the BDcraft website, you must first accept the cookies.  You probably already know this popup from other sites.  Either you click directly on &#8220;Accept&#8221; or on &#8220;Advanced settings&#8221; to get to the data protection dashboard.<\/p>\n<p>2. As a second step, scroll down the page a bit.  There you select a game version (e.g. 1.16) and a resolution (e.g. 512x) under the subheading &#8220;Download&#8221;.  However, due to technical limitations, the best resolution only works with Nvidia 10 Series or better graphics card.  Unfortunately, Intel and AMD users cannot use 512x as a result.  At this point you can also view the full changelog, which lists the latest updates.<\/p>\n<p>3. Once you have made your selection, you can click &#8220;Download&#8221; to allow the Sphax PureBDcraft Texture Pack to download.  Now a popup appears again showing you two buttons.  We recommend you select &#8220;Download with AD&#8221; because you don&#8217;t have to spend any money.  Alternatively, you can sign up for a paid membership.<\/p><source  type=\"image\/webp\" data-><img alt=\"BDcraftnet Become a supporter Alert\" class=\"wp-image-10529 lazyload\" width=\"350\" height=\"88\" data-eio=\"p\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654645718_240_PureBDcraft-Texture-Pack-118-1182-\u2192-117.jpg\" decoding=\"async\"  data-\/><\/source><\/p>\n<p>4. Now at the latest you will notice that in this case there are actually a few steps to be completed, because another page will now open.  At this point you will be shown the terms of use, which stipulate, for example, that you may not use PureBDcraft for a remix pack.  Read the terms carefully and only click &#8220;Accept&#8221; if you agree.<\/p><source  type=\"image\/webp\" data-><img width=\"982\" height=\"520\" data-id=\"10527\" alt=\"BDcraft Terms of use\" class=\"wp-image-10527 lazyload\" data-eio=\"p\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654645719_682_PureBDcraft-Texture-Pack-118-1182-\u2192-117.jpg\" decoding=\"async\"  data-\/><\/source><\/p>\n<p>5. Now you have to watch 15 seconds advertisement on the site.  The message &#8220;Your download is ready&#8221; will then appear at the top, letting you know that you can download the file.  The length of the download process that starts now depends on how good your internet connection is and what resolution you have chosen.<\/p>\n<p>6. Next, open Minecraft and navigate to &#8220;Options&#8221; and then to &#8220;Resource Packs&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>7. Then click on &#8220;Open resource pack folder&#8221;.  Move the previously downloaded zip file, which you normally do not have to unpack, into your Resourcepacks folder.<\/p>\n<p>8. Return to Minecraft and click on the pack to activate it.<\/p>\n<p>9. Finally, click on &#8220;Done&#8221; and the installation is complete.  Wait a moment for the game to load the new textures.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes the last step can cause Minecraft to crash and no longer open because your hardware is too bad.  In this case you should allocate more RAM to Minecraft and think about choosing a lower resolution.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"title\">\ud83d\udd14 Note:<\/h4>\n<p>We are happy if you share this post.<\/p>\n<p>None of the files are on our server.
