And it&#8217;s going quite peacefully.  So just to keep hungry you have to butcher a pig every now and then\u2026 or roast a chicken.  (Don&#8217;t eat the latter raw &#8211; it could contain salmonella, which could poison you. And then the hunger pangs are lost very quickly.)<br \/>And my kids know: You can also install a vegan mod &#8211; so everything is easy!<br \/>The bottom line here is respect and creativity:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Mining and crafting instead of beating and shooting.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>And condolences&#8230;<\/strong><br \/>Because your kids will become one <strong>speak language<\/strong>, where you probably only understand train station.  be there <strong>mob<\/strong> and <strong>monster<\/strong> <strong>spawned<\/strong>, <strong>biomes<\/strong> researched, <strong>mods<\/strong> tried out, <strong>skins<\/strong> created, diamond swords <strong>crafted<\/strong> and one <strong>Enderman<\/strong> it&#8217;s better not to look into the eyes&#8230;<br \/><strong>huh?!?<br \/><\/strong>In addition, there is a very high probability that your children will <strong>never voluntarily<\/strong> stop playing&#8230; Your kid is one of 100 million gamers who just can&#8217;t tear themselves away?

Particularly nerdy sections are marked &#8211; like spicy food on a menu &#8211; and can be skipped if necessary.  It helped me a lot to understand my sons&#8217; gibberish.  On top of that, in addition to facts and tips, the book also offers plenty of anti-frustration solutions.  Definitely recommended reading for all concerned parents.<br \/>Here&#8217;s a little foretaste:<\/p>\n<h2>Essential Minecraft knowledge for parents<\/h2>\n<p>With the kind permission of the publisher:<\/p>\n<h3>What kids love about Minecraft<\/h3>\n<p>But first things first, what is it that makes Minecraft so irresistible for kids (and the young at heart)?<\/p>\n<h4>Creative, cool and easy<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>One can feel extraordinary <strong>creative<\/strong> actuate;  comparable to Lego, but larger and programmable.<\/li>\n<li>The environment is <strong>&#8220;cool&#8221;<\/strong>: It is technically modern, because you play on the PC or on the console, but retro-stylish in the minimalistic game &#8211; the contrast makes it.<\/li>\n<li>There is <strong>few easy-to-learn rules of the game<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Of the <strong>retro minimalism<\/strong> hits not only that <strong>Zeitgeist<\/strong>Blocks just got it: Bricks, cement blocks, Lego bricks, Minecraft blocks &#8211; all share the same irresistible need to be piled on top of each other to build something.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>I&#8217;m the boss here!<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>the <strong>First person perspective<\/strong> of the character helps to delve into the game world.<\/li>\n<li>That <strong>Homely and adventurer feeling:<\/strong> In Minecraft you can set up a (virtual digital) headquarters in a safe place to start risky adventures in all directions from there.<\/li>\n<li>The players have <strong>power of decision<\/strong> about construction and destruction without any consequences in real life.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Pleasant gaming experience<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>the <strong>feel<\/strong> is stimulating: It ranges from simple and effective controls to pleasantly accompanying sound effects such as the satisfying popping sound when mining materials.<\/li>\n<li>That <strong>gameplay<\/strong> offers the <strong>right balance<\/strong> between challenge and reward, fun and creativity.<\/li>\n<li>Creativity again: In all its facets and channels (including the online community), not only the game, but the entire Minecraft theme offers countless opportunities for expression.<\/li>\n<li>For introverts and extroverts and the many human profiles in between: Either you play Minecraft <strong>alone or together<\/strong>when meeting like-minded people online.  Or you can find the ideal path in between in the huge range of Minecraft activities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>For the younger ones:<\/strong> There is <strong>a lot to see<\/strong>.  Even if the child is too young for all aspects of play, the basic learning process &#8211; watch and imitate &#8211; is triggered as the child sits next to the older brother or sister or watches the YouTube heroes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Teamwork:<\/strong> Experimenting together and achieving something &#8211; this develops skills in thinking, mathematics, geometry, spatial thinking and even teaches a touch of geology.  The immediate application of what has been learned creates a feeling of reward including the appropriate hormones.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Big projects<\/strong> require intensive planning, sub-goals and more detailed team organization, almost like a real job.  The fun of this satisfying &#8220;work&#8221; and the feeling of reward from the result are in turn appealing.<br \/>\u00a9 Rheinwerk Verlag, Bonn 2018<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Minecraft for Parents: What Mom Learned<\/h3>\n<p>And now I&#8217;ll tell you a little about what I&#8217;ve learned there:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Good to know:<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Monsters cannot see through glass<\/strong> &#8211; very convenient.  Also, they don&#8217;t spawn near torches &#8211; so always light things up nicely!<br \/>For a trip to the <strong>Nether<\/strong> always enough <strong>quarry stone<\/strong> carry!  Helps against the fireballs of the nether ghasts.<br \/>Mobs and monsters do not spawn on clear blocks.<br \/>Obsidian is the second hardest material in Minecraft and can also withstand creepers and TNT.<br \/>An Enderman should <strong>never look in the eye<\/strong>.  Because then he gets red eyes and attacks!  (Remedy: Put on the pumpkin.)<br \/>Complex machines can be crafted with Redstone as an energy source.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Minecraft is extensible:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Various extensions are available for download on the Internet: skins, resource packs, maps, mods (modifications &#8211; such as JurassiCraft with dinosaurs).  Such extensions are often recommended in relevant YouTube videos &#8211; and then of course the child must have something like that.  Well, a double-edged sword &#8230; By the way: The maps have ready-made Hogwarts landscapes\/buildings for Harry Potter fans or Westeros for Game of Thrones fans.  The book mentioned above explains how to install something like this.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Online multiplayer is more fun&#8230;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>But it is also more challenging for parents.  Because: Not every multi-player server offers harmless content and, as is well known, there are idiots everywhere.  A multiplayer game or your own Minecraft server in the home network may be a viable alternative.  But then it gets really nerdy \u2013 even if the book accompanies you well.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Safe on the Internet:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The book not only reveals knowledge for Minecraft itself, but also how parents can create a &#8211; reasonably &#8211; safe environment so that their children do not end up on dubious portals and content on the Internet or accidentally download malware.  Thumbs up!  Even my &#8220;house nerd&#8221; got some ideas from there&#8230; And I always thought it couldn&#8217;t get any more nerdy&#8230;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Last but not least: cats help against creepers.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>But you have to tame this cat first: hold out the raw fish, don&#8217;t wave it around or jump around, then the cat will come &#8211; maybe.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>You might also be interested in:<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">The book was provided to me by the publisher.<br \/>Thank you for your support!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Contains affiliate links<\/p>\n<p><b>Your regional bookstore will also be happy to order the book for you!<\/b> Then: <i>When the last shop is gone, the last coffee shop is closed and all the neighborhoods are deserted, you&#8217;ll realize that online shopping wasn&#8217;t so great after all! <\/i><b>Buy local!<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">For more fairness and transparency online: Affiliate links lead to products in online shops.
