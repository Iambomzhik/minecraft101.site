Enjoy the exciting Minecraft adventures that await you with LEGO Minecraft The Skull Arena (21145), specially designed for fans of the hugely successful video game.<\/p>\n<p>This is how one of the latest LEGO Minecraft sets is advertised in the LEGO online shop.  The Skull Arena is officially available from LEGO from August 1st, 2018.  However, this set is already available in most LEGO brand stores and in LEGOLAND Germany.  And that&#8217;s where my son and I bought it last Saturday.  For a recommended retail price of 19.99 euros, we received 198 LEGO bricks and an entertaining assembly pass.  More on that in the following review.<\/p>\n<h3>packaging and content<\/h3>\n<p>As is usual with LEGO Minecraft sets, the parts and the building instructions are packed in a sturdy box.  However, this box is only just over half filled with two bags and the building instructions.<\/p>\n<p>Packaging of the LEGO Minecraft 21145 set.

(Photo: PROMOBRICKS)<\/p>\n<p>After opening the two bags and briefly sorting the 198 parts, all the parts are neatly arranged on the table.  If you want to follow the instructions strictly, you can of course build bag number 1 first and then bag number 2.  The first bag contains the minifigures and the main part of the arena\/island, the second bag only contains the skull.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"lazyload wp-image-65593 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655859890_774_LEGO-Minecraft-21145-The-Skull-Arena-Review.jpg\" alt=\"LEGO Minecraft 21145 The Skull Arena Review\" width=\"750\" height=\"478\"  data-\/>All 198 parts neatly sorted.  (Photo: PROMOBRICKS)<\/p>\n<h3>In a nutshell: assembly<\/h3>\n<p>The 198 parts are put together quite quickly in a total of 57 construction steps.  Typically, the minifigures with accessories come first, followed by the arena and the skull.  You will usually look in vain for special building techniques in LEGO Minecraft sets.  This is also the case here, although this set almost only consists of stones, tiles and slabs anyway.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"lazyload wp-image-65594 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655859890_136_LEGO-Minecraft-21145-The-Skull-Arena-Review.jpg\" alt=\"LEGO Minecraft 21145 The Skull Arena Review\" width=\"750\" height=\"469\"  data-\/>The set&#8217;s two LEGO Minecraft minifigures.

(Photo. PROMOBRICKS)<\/p>\n<p>What I find most interesting is the white skull with its red (glowing) eyes and golden crown.  In addition to the golden apple, the sword and the axe, the set also includes 16 golden LEGO elements, all of which are used for the crown.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the skull also offers a shooter function, which can be operated on the back.  Then the green slime cannon on the front is shot.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"lazyload wp-image-65584 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655859890_330_LEGO-Minecraft-21145-The-Skull-Arena-Review.jpg\" alt=\"LEGO Minecraft 21145 The Skull Arena Review\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\"  data-\/>The skull with the red eyes.

(Photo: PROMOBRICKS)<\/p>\n<p>Due to the good sorting before building, the small LEGO Minecraft set was assembled by children&#8217;s hands after about 20 minutes.  Many thanks to my son, who actively supported me here.<\/p>\n<h3>Preview of more LEGO Minecraft sets<\/h3>\n<p>At the end of the building instructions you will find the illustrations of the other LEGO Minecraft sets, which are available directly from LEGO from today.  There is also a nice overview of the expansion options for the latest LEGO Minecraft sets.  Here it becomes clear that the three new sets can easily be added to existing LEGO Minecraft islands.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"lazyload wp-image-65592 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655859891_676_LEGO-Minecraft-21145-The-Skull-Arena-Review.jpg\" alt=\"LEGO Minecraft 21145 The Skull Arena Review\" width=\"750\" height=\"563\"  data-\/>Overview of the LEGO Minecraft sets for the second half of 2018.

(Photo: PROMOBRICKS)<\/p>\n<h3>My conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>LEGO Minecraft is a topic that keeps bringing us new sets.  Not in the same quantities as LEGO Star Wars, of course, but something new comes out of the series almost every six months.  And if kids are to be believed these days, Minecraft is still pretty hot.  Suitable for the actual target group: children and young people between the ages of seven and 14.  This set is either a nice introduction to the Minecraft world or a nice extension for the existing sets.  The Skull Arena is not only a colorful set because of the orange lava, the skull is also a real eye-catcher.  With a stone price of exactly ten cents, this set is almost up to the current standard and will certainly not only please the die-hard Minecraft fan.<\/p>\n<p>We still had a lot of fun with the \u201cplayers\u201d and the \u201ckiller bunny\u201d after the set-up.  Even the current set is still being used well.  Exactly how it should be.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dodge the slime shooter and defeat your opponent to win the golden apple and go head-to-head with the killer rabbit <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1450,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1435"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1435"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1435\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1450"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1435"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1435"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1435"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
