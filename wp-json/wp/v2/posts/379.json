This is only available in the Microsoft Store for \u20ac29.99.  In addition, there is the well-known Java version (23.95\u20ac).<\/p>\n<p>Basically, both versions support texture packs.  However, the Java version has a clear advantage here.  It has been around much longer and is therefore better supported by developers.  However, the very popular shaders, which greatly enhance the game&#8217;s visuals, are only available in the Java version.<br \/>While there is a marketplace in the Windows 10 version where you can purchase paid skins, texture packs and worlds, this does not exist on Java.  Here 99% of all packs can be downloaded for free from the Internet.  Advantage Windows: with the Bedrock Edition you can play together on Windows 10, the Xbox One and the Nintendo Switch, since all of these platforms support crossplay.<\/p>\n<p><strong>a notice<\/strong>: Buyers of the Java edition before October 29, 2018 will already get the Bedrock version for Windows 10 for free!
