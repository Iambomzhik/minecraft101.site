This will be available in the Windows Store and, as has now been announced, will bring the achievements known from the Xbox version to Windows 10.<\/p>\n<h2>Cookie hit for Windows 10<\/h2>\n<p>Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition, as the app variant of the game is officially called, is certainly a prime game for the Microsoft operating system.  It is certainly commendable that previous players are not asked to pay a second time, but if you don&#8217;t have the Mojang megahit yet, you will have to pay 10 dollars or euros for the game.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft manager Mike Ybarra has now announced a small but certainly fine detail of the Windows 10 version of Minecraft on the Twitter short message service: Accordingly, the game will support achievements on the new operating system.\n<\/p>\n<p>These successes will be a novelty for the PC version, the previous desktop version did not have them, at least not in the form known from the Xbox.  Achievements will be visible within the Windows 10 Xbox app, so they will probably also count towards a user&#8217;s Gamerscore.  You can&#8217;t buy anything for it, of course, but achievements have been a popular and motivating element on the Xbox ever since they were introduced.<\/p>\n<p>The Windows 10 Edition was only announced at the beginning of the month, as mentioned, this edition of the game is running as a beta for the time being.  It is not known how long this preliminary phase will last, but there will be a special feedback mechanism on board that Microsoft will use to collect player feedback.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>See also:<\/b> Minecraft Windows 10 Edition Beta &#8211; Customized Version as of July 29th<\/p>\n<p>\t<br \/>\n\tWindows 10, developer, minecraft, mojang, windows 10 edition mojang<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Minecraft-Windows-10-Edition-gets-achievements-in-the-beta.gif\" width=\"https:\/\/winfuture.de\/1\" height=\"https:\/\/winfuture.de\/1\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not only will Windows 10 be released on Wednesday next week, on July 29 the game developer Mojang, who has <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":708,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/705"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=705"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/705\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/708"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=705"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=705"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=705"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
