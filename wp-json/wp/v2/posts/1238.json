My son&#8217;s friends who have older brothers know about it, and he&#8217;s asked me about it a few times. I don&#8217;t know when I want my 6 year old to expose the deep dark world of games.<\/p>\n<p>I used to have one <strong>PS2<\/strong>. I owned it for just a few weeks before I sold it. I spent a whole weekend playing <strong>Metal Gear Solid<\/strong> imprisoned and realized he had an obsession that ended. I already spend too much time online, I don&#8217;t need to spend more time playing.<\/p>\n<p>Still loves JP <strong>Minecraft<\/strong> for his son. He has set up a private server for his son and friends and he can monitor down everything that&#8217;s going on.

LEGO is missing out on big time in my opinion. That went with 3rd person shooters, what do Legoish ask about that?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s when I saw my sons playing yet another Lego Star Wars Shooting Games game on the <strong>iPad<\/strong> Tonight I&#8217;m frustrated I haven&#8217;t figured out a better way for her to utilize her digital time.
