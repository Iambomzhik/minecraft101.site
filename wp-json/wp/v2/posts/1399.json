As long as the light value is greater than 7, you are in the clear as no enemy monsters can spawn. <\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">While the debug screen already makes glare a bit redundant, glare has a few benefits, such as the ability to hover over otherwise passable dark areas, while still being pretty adorable.  This should make the Glare a useful companion when mining or crafting as long as it is added to the game. <\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Minecraft Live 2021: Vote for the glare!\" width=\"1140\" height=\"641\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/uYIQsr9vsws?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">In the blog post, Mojang announced that Glare will be one of the three potential monsters that could be added to Minecraft, so expect to hear about the other two possible monsters soon, as Mojang will likely announce them beforehand. <\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">Minecraft Live is slated to begin later this week on October 16 at 5:00pm ET \/ XNUMX:XNUMX PM BST, so drop by if you get a chance to vote on the next crowd to come to Minecraft. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mojang has announced the first contender that could be Minecraft&#8217;s next monster, the Glare, a floating bush with eyes.
