You can get free versions here.<\/p>\n<p>Although there is &#8220;Minecraft&#8221; for almost all current platforms for relatively little money, but if you want to take a closer look at the work and test it, it doesn&#8217;t have to cost anything right away. Because on the one hand you can look at the original, on the other hand all sorts of &#8220;Minecraft&#8221; clones and cheeky copies. All these games not only hint at what the masterpiece has to offer.<\/p>\n<h2>Minecraft classic for free in the browser<\/h2>\n<p>For the 10th birthday of &#8220;Minecraft&#8221;, the developer Mojang released the so-called classic version some time ago. It doesn&#8217;t look nearly as chic as the current version of the 3D building game, but it impressively shows the beginnings of the cult. &#8220;Minecraft Classic&#8221; can even be played for free in the browser at classic.minecraft.net, so you don&#8217;t even have to download anything.<\/p>\n<p>Minecraft Classic is no longer beautiful. (Photo: Screenshot)<\/p>\n<p>If you want, you can even invite friends and use &#8220;Minecraft Classic&#8221; together. Too bad you can&#8217;t easily save the game. So this variant is more of a kind of demo. Tip: If necessary, leave the browser tab open so that you can continue from the same places later.<\/p>\n<h2>Lots of free minecraft games<\/h2>\n<p>Where else can I find free Minecraft games? With providers like Fizgames. Browser games with names like \u201cPixel Craft\u201d, \u201cPixel City\u201d, \u201cMine Box\u201d or \u201cMinecraft Builder\u201d await you there. Some variants focus on solo challenges, while others focus on creating imaginative, fun 3D worlds. And some of them almost go in the direction of action shooters &#8211; ideal snacks to pass the time.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655319754_719_Where-are-free-versions-available.jpg\" alt=\"The agony of choice.

(Photo: Screenshot)<\/p>\n<p>The area of \u200b\u200b\u201cMinecraft\u201d copies in particular is now huge. This also shows how different the block-based representation of game worlds can be. And: Not only the developers of Mojang are very creative.<\/p>\n<h2>Minetest: Open to everyone<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cMinetest\u201d is extremely exciting. The software is completely free of charge and relies on open source structures. This means that the source code can be changed, improved and used by anyone. If you are not a developer, you can also generate fascinating worlds here alone or with friends. This works optionally locally in a network without a connection to the Internet.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655319755_3_Where-are-free-versions-available.jpg\" alt=\"Minetest can look very fancy.

(Photo: Minetest)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Minetest&#8221; even allows you to change the entire look by using special texture packs. And there are pretty landscape tools too. Minetest is available for Windows, macOS, Linux and Android.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you only play the real &#8220;Minecraft&#8221; or are you also interested in the similar alternatives?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Summary:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655319756_815_Where-are-free-versions-available.jpg\" alt=\"Minecraft: where to find free versions\" width=\"180\" height=\"106\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You just want to get a quick taste of &#8220;Minecraft&#8221; and get to know the incredibly multifaceted adventure?
