In fact, playing video games provides numerous brain benefits, from better memory and problem solving to a better mood and social skills.<\/p>\n<h2>1. A better memory<\/h2>\n<p>Many video games require a high level of strategy and focus. Navigating the virtual world of video games is very similar to navigating the real world. If you have to reconcile several tasks when navigating in a virtual space, the hippocampus is trained. This is the part of the brain that is the interface between short- and long-term memory and controls spatial memory.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Spatial imagination<\/h2>\n<p>Playing video games can also improve spatial awareness. Players can better judge distances between objects or mentally rotate objects to imagine how they might fit into a space. This improved spatial perception helps in real life, for example when parking in tight parking spaces.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Solve problems<\/h2>\n<p>Strategy and role-playing games challenge players to solve complex problems. This virtual problem solving is a great exercise for real hurdles. Almost every video game genre involves problem solving, whether it&#8217;s solving a puzzle or finding the fastest escape route. Solving these problems requires both memorization and analytical skills, as well as a lot of creativity.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Better mood<\/h2>\n<p>Video games can also be a great way to de-stress and relax. Video games that are complex and deep can actually be quite therapeutic. When the player is completely immersed in a digital world, there is no time to take care of work or bills. Video games can be a perfect way to give the brain a break from the problems and stresses of everyday life.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Social Skills<\/h2>\n<p>The social benefits of video games are much debated and some people argue that video games result in poor social skills or loneliness. However, moderate gaming can actually improve social skills and reduce anxiety. When players can take on fictional roles in a virtual world, they can experiment with social interactions to learn about appropriate social behavior.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Stimulating the brain<\/h2>\n<p>Basically, the brain grows when playing video games. Figuring out how a game works and solving puzzles to beat a level forms new connections in your brain. The more motivated the player is to win the game, the harder the brain works and the more new connections are formed. Regular stimulation of the brain is important to keep it healthy as you age.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This content is sponsored.
