Eight sentences that are good for every child.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/p>\n<p>During the holiday season we publish texts that were particularly talkative.  This post first appeared on January 8, 2019.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Words sometimes work wonders &#8211; for a lifetime.  Photo: iStock<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Then do it,&#8221; &#8220;Of course you can.&#8221;  When I think of my father, I remember sentences like this.  He himself lived by their credo until his death, and he couldn&#8217;t tell us children often enough that you should follow your heart and dare something in life.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t stand in your own way, trust yourself, he kept saying.  He relied on the power of words and thoughts.  As a child, that impressed me and also helped me.  Even later, his words gave me courage during trials, difficult hours and difficult decisions.  They had become a kind of mantra for me.  As a single mother of a baby and with some problems, I drew important strength from it for a while.<\/p>\n<p>Reading Fatherly, a US father blog, made me realize the importance of such phrases again.  In one post, the author lists words and phrases that parents should say to their children on a regular basis.  There is talk of &#8220;magical parent words&#8221;.  I have taken some of them and added my own terms &#8211; for example:<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;I like having you&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>You can say this sentence over and over again, to your children and to your favorite people.  It does not wear out because it becomes weaker with repetition.  &#8220;I love you.&#8221;  My family often shouts this sentence to each other when leaving the house, we say it when we say good night, after an argument, when we encourage each other, when we are having a good time together&#8230; so often.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Try it&#8221; <\/strong><br \/>Life is rich, the child should try things, discover and find out what he likes.  Sometimes you need a push to do something new or to approach other people.  Therefore: \u00abJust try it!\u00bb<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;For real?&#8221;  \/ &#8220;Is that true?&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>Children should learn to tell the truth.  If you ask whether what they said or heard is really true, you give them the opportunity to pause for a moment, think about it and, if necessary, revise it.  &#8220;Word of honor?&#8221; my husband and I would often say when our children were younger and they were making claims.  They often responded with: &#8220;Hmm, so maybe not quite.&#8221;  Or: \u00abSo it bitzli.\u00bb<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;I am sorry&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>We make mistakes, say the wrong thing, misbehave.  This can happen and we apologize for it.  Just as we expect our children to do when they make a mistake.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Please&#8221; and &#8220;Thank you&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>They are considered magic words.  A &#8220;request&#8221; contains respect, politeness and a request that the addressee can also refuse.  If you ask your children for things and say that word over and over again, hopefully one day the children will do the same.  The situation is similar with the word \u201cthank you\u201d, this word also shows appreciation.  &#8220;Thanks for cleaning up \/ clearing the table \/ emptying the compost \/ helping the neighbor.&#8221;  Although that should not be said every time, at some point certain things have to be taken for granted.  <\/p>\n<p>As good as these two words are, in my opinion, they can also be abused by parents: if, in the manner of a commander, they extort a pressed \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d from the little ones every time they pee, it seems like a sad power game.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>\u00abExplain to me why \/ why\u00bb<br \/><\/strong>The child should argue, offer a counter-suggestion, or explain himself instead of just complaining when something is suggested (e.g. a trip) or forbidden.  The sentence goes in the same direction: &#8220;Do you have an idea how we can solve this?&#8221;  Because little people can think for themselves and don&#8217;t have to have everything suggested.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know it&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>We parents cannot and do not need to know and explain everything.  Saying you don&#8217;t know where the souls of the dead go or why someone was mean to you is honest and authentic.  A conversation may or may not result from this.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">&#8220;Nice day!  Enjoy it.&#8221;<br \/><\/strong>This sentence is always meant literally, but between the lines it also means: &#8220;Take care of yourself, watch out for traffic, and your fellow human beings should please mean well with you.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Please complete the list, dear reader.
