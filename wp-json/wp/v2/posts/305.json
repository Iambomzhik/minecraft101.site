There are many reasons for this.  First of all, the game couldn&#8217;t be simpler.  The simple, angular graphics may not be able to keep up with many other video games at first glance, but it has its own charm.  Many children are also happy that the game does not have a fixed goal or a tight scoring system in which you have to compete with other players.  It&#8217;s all about one thing: creativity.  The children can live out their creativity in this game, there are hardly any limits to their fantasies.  With the almost infinite selection of blocks implemented in the game, all sorts of different buildings or the like can be built.  So the child can build his own little kingdom.  The player can set his own goal, especially when it comes to creative projects, which significantly increases the motivation to play.  But the adventure instinct in every child is not neglected.  You can fight monsters that may seem scary at first, but look almost funny to kids (and parents) upon closer inspection.<\/p>\n<p>The game is very popular among teenagers and elementary school students, so Lego couldn&#8217;t escape the hype and offers various creative boxes and construction toys.<\/p>\n<h2>Minecraft images<\/h2>\n<p>Playing Minecraft on your smartphone is fun!
