The non-profit organization accuses the rights holder Microsoft that the game is a playground for sex offenders.  In an online petition, the parent-led initiative calls on the company to make changes, primarily to the game&#8217;s chat function, where the perpetrators approached the children.  These would have to be led by moderators, it is said.  In addition, the minimum age for private messages should be raised to a minimum age.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The open world of &#8220;Minecraft&#8221;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In the open-world game &#8220;Minecraft&#8221; players can design their own world.

(Image: ddp\/Chicago Tribune\/MCT\/Sipa USA)<\/p>\n<p>The use of &#8220;Minecraft&#8221; is exploding, with many children chatting, playing and even doing schoolwork with friends outside of school, writes ParentsTogether with a view to the current development.  The platform is also a &#8220;popular hunting ground for child molesters&#8221; who &#8220;chat with children, ask them for pictures and then blackmail them to get more.&#8221;  Given these conditions, Microsoft can and must act immediately.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Also read: <\/strong><strong>When Bing is suddenly the default search in the Chrome browser<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The petition has already been signed by 120,000 parents in the United States, the organization said in a statement published on its website on May 26.  There she refers to other measures she has taken against the game.  Among other things, an artist was commissioned to design an installation in the style of the game, which reads that &#8220;sex offenders prey on children in Minecraft&#8221;.  Another installation said the game&#8217;s creators ignored the concerns of 120,000 parents.<\/p>\n<p>Continue reading<\/p>\n<h2><strong>That&#8217;s what those affected say<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>To substantiate the allegations, ParentsTogether has also published the statements of some affected parents.  &#8220;Scary people are trying to contact my child in Minecraft,&#8221; says a mother.  &#8220;Fortunately, my child knows to ask me,&#8221; she adds.  Another mother also reports that players approached her six-year-old daughter in the chat.  They are said to have threatened the girl that they would end their friendship if she didn&#8217;t send them pictures.<\/p>\n<p>This content comes from a third party.

In fact, the FBI security agency had already issued a warning in March that children were spending more time online due to the corona crisis and were therefore at risk of sexual exploitation and abuse.  The problem is also discussed in the media.  ParentsTogether references the New York Times article that described Minecraft and similar games as &#8220;sex offender hunting grounds.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Microsoft takes a stand<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>After ParentsTogether emailed the online petition to Microsoft on April 30, the company has since responded, the organization said.  The answer in the form of a statement is available from the tech magazine Mashable.  It states that the Microsoft-owned development company Majong Studios takes the security of the players &#8220;very seriously&#8221;.  The company has the \u201cbest tools and services in the industry to ensure minors have a \u201csafe, fun and positive experience.\u201d One of the tools is \u201cparental control.\u201d Children under the age of 13 need their consent Parents to play &#8220;Minecraft&#8221; Filters would also be used in chat rooms and a team of moderators would remove &#8220;dangerous and inappropriate&#8221; content.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Also read: <\/strong><strong>Data protection officer follows up dispute with Microsoft<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>However, ParentsTogether is not satisfied with the answer and apparently also with the measures mentioned.
