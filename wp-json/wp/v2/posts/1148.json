And by that I don&#8217;t just mean that a game is so great that it&#8217;s &#8220;addicting&#8221;. We use the term addiction in its most current form, as the gambling addict cannot function in regular society and also shies away from all duties just to keep gambling.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a point. The Globe Wellness Organization (WHO) has also confirmed &#8220;gambling disorder&#8221; as an addiction and will include it in the ICD-11 (International Classification of Illness) for 2022. The only other non-substantive abuse addictions on the ICD-11 are gambling addiction, and since both PC gaming and gaming are carefully linked (I&#8217;m looking at you, loot boxes) ), including PC gaming makes a lot of sense.<\/p>\n<p>by clutch<\/p>\n<p>But there is still debate as to whether or not gaming should be considered an addiction. To learn more details, Clutch.win decided to conduct its own study of gamers to see if they could be considered addicts according to the Greenfield Computer Game Addiction Examination.<\/p>\n<p>Out of 1,570 Clutch users rated, 27.8% scored above 41.2 in the test, suggesting they &#8220;might have some level of problematic video game use&#8221;. Whether this translates into addiction is harder to say because the research isn&#8217;t really scientific, but it&#8217;s a worrying sign.<\/p>\n<p>The study also made some unusual discoveries. Out of all the games available, Minecraft has been ranked as one of the most addictive. People don&#8217;t typically think of Minecraft as a terrible habit-forming video game, but Clutch points out that Minecraft doesn&#8217;t have the same breaks as regular video games, so people just keep playing since there&#8217;s no natural indicator of when you need to take a break.<\/p>\n<p>by means of a clutch<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Clutch found that of all study participants who were 18+ and were Minecraft players, 50% of them claimed that they depended on their mothers and fathers for financial support. That&#8217;s right: Fifty percent of all adult Minecraft players rely on their parents to support them.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s more fascinating stuff to be found on Clutch&#8217;s survey, although we&#8217;re quick to state that this is hardly a medical research study and should be taken with caution. Still, you currently know why your Minecraft addicted buddy manages to be unemployed for a year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A brand new research study has actually uncovered a bizarre connection where adults addicted to Minecraft are financially supported by <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1149,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1148"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1148"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1148\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1619,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1148\/revisions\/1619"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1149"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1148"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1148"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1148"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
