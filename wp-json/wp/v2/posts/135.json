For the anniversary, Mojang&#8217;s developers have come up with something very special and are bringing a retro version of the block classic to your browser.  Means for you, you have access to the 32 well-tried stones of the early version.  The interface and the gameplay also do not differ from the original version &#8211; bugs included.<\/p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"arve-iframe fitvidsignore\" frameborder=\"0\" name=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/DBHpyVankNU?iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;autoplay=0\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Video: Youtube \/ Phoenix SC<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"ftoc-heading-3\" class=\"ftwp-heading\"><strong>How to play Minecraft Classic in the browser<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>To start the game, follow this link in the browser of your choice and off you go.  But be aware of how rudimentary the game was back then.  Only a few of the current features are available to you.  For example, there were no creepers or other opponents back then.  The survival mode, underground dungeons, cities or the now very extensive crafting system was not there ten years ago.  Of course, the game only really works with a mouse and keyboard, which is why mobile gamers get nothing.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Huge new map for game owners<br \/><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Mojang has come up with another special feature for the celebration.  In the current version, a specially developed anniversary card is waiting for you, which you can discover in the form of an interactive museum.  This is available free of charge in the Marketplace for all gamers of the mobile, console and Windows versions.  If you prefer to create the new world in the Java version, follow this link instead.  In addition to information about the individual versions of the game, the map also gives you a detailed overview of the different building blocks and opponents as well as numerous easter eggs and secrets.<\/p>\n<p>Are you playing Minecraft for the first time?
