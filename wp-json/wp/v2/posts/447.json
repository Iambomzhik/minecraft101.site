It runs on Java technology, which makes it playable on any device that has Java installed, regardless of the operating system.  To do this, you need the associated launcher program to start.  It can be changed and expanded by players with their own resource packs, data packs, skins and modifications.  There are no paid add-ons.  The game is produced by the Swedish company Mojang.\n<\/p>\n<p>The Java Edition consists of client and server.  For single player mode the client contains an integrated server, for multiplayer mode the server is installed and configured separately from the clients.  Anyone can run such a Minecraft server.  There is also a wide range of free, public servers.\n<\/p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>logo<\/th>\n<th>device<\/th>\n<th>description<\/th>\n<th>Price<\/th>\n<th>publication<\/th>\n<th>Current version<\/th>\n<th>article\n<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 150px\">\n<td><\/td>\n<td>personal computer  <\/td>\n<td>Initially, the version could only be played in the browser, since Alpha 1.0.0 Mojang has had a launcher.<\/td>\n<td>\u20ac23.95<\/td>\n<td>First release in early alpha stage: May 17, 2009<br \/>Official full version: November 18, 2011<\/td>\n<td>1.18.2<\/td>\n<td>link\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 150px\">\n<td><img alt=\"Minecraft China Logo.png\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654549982_600_Minecraft-Editions-Minecraft-Wiki.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"265\" height=\"100\" data-image-name=\"Minecraft China Logo.png\" data-image-key=\"Minecraft_China_Logo.png\"\/><\/td>\n<td>personal computer<\/td>\n<td>In the Chinese version of the Java Edition, the Forge modification is integrated.

Her name was then <i>Pocket edition<\/i> and was developed by Mojang alone.  Over time, various offshoots emerged, which were mainly developed by the American Microsoft subsidiary Microsoft Studios, such as  B. the <i>Windows 10 Edition<\/i>.  In September 2017, some offshoots and a former console edition were integrated into the Bedrock Edition and this only <i>Minecraft<\/i> mentioned without further addition.  With the transition of the PlayStation 4 Edition to the Bedrock Edition on December 10, 2019, the Bedrock Edition is the only active development version of Minecraft besides the Java Edition and all console editions have been retired.\n<\/p>\n<p>The name <i>Bed Rock Edition<\/i> is not at stake, but is used by the manufacturer and the community to distinguish this version from the others.  The Bedrock Edition and its offshoots are written in the C++ programming language.  In contrast to the Java Edition, there were no options for changing the game for a long time.  Some of these have since been added, but as paid add-ons that can be purchased via the integrated marketplace, as well as limited game modifications as so-called add-ons.\n<\/p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>logo<\/th>\n<th>device<\/th>\n<th>description<\/th>\n<th>Price<\/th>\n<th>publication<\/th>\n<th>Current version<\/th>\n<th>article\n<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img alt=\"MC Bedrock Logo.svg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"400\" height=\"69\" data-image-name=\"MC Bedrock Logo.svg\" data-image-key=\"MC_Bedrock_Logo.svg\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654549982_740_Minecraft-Editions-Minecraft-Wiki.png\" class=\"lazyload\"\/>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<p>mobile devices<\/p>\n<p>Windows 10 devices<\/p>\n<p>Fire TV devices<\/p>\n<p>Xbox One\/<br \/>Xbox Series X\/S[# 1]<br \/>  ( )<br \/>\n<br \/>Nintendo switch<\/p>\n<p>PlayStation 4\/<br \/>PlayStation 5[# 1]<br \/>  ( )<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td>This edition was originally <i>Pocket edition<\/i> and appeared first for Android, then for other touchscreen mobile devices.

But that wasn&#8217;t the case.  Rather, the Java Edition team in Stockholm\/Sweden and the Bedrock Edition team in Redmond\/USA have been working together on new updates ever since.
