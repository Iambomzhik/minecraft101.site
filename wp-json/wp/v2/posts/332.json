Of course it&#8217;s not forbidden for children but, well&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Although it sounds weird, Minecraft is educational in many ways for your child. For example, your child can be creative when it comes to building. With the so-called &#8220;Redstone&#8221; you can develop entire mechanisms that, among other things, represent a computer that actually works.<\/p>\n<p>In some ways, Minecraft also breeds stupidity: there are over 20 million Minecraft servers out there to play with other people. Here are games provided by the server developer. These have a certain goal and do not offer their child freedom or creativity. There are also such games where you compete against other players in battles. This leads to brutality. There are also a number of Minecraft modifications that change the game by a few features. But you have to download a modding API called Forge.<\/p>\n<p>Here we recommend you the article by Anton, which you may know from the article &#8220;My Top 5 Minecraft Mods and Servers&#8221;. There is one mod I strongly recommend: Computercraft! This modification offers your child the opportunity to program and use their own devices.<\/p>\n<p>We hope you found this article useful when it comes to Minecraft.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>by Oscar Gr\u00e4ber and Anton Regneri (Grade 5) FYI: This article is primarily intended for parents.
