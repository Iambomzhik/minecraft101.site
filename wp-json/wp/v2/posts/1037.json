There is no specific goal other than to<strong> survive and wander through an infinite world<\/strong> and using the different blocks we have (stone, granite, iron, grass, etc.) to build and destroy objects.  The worlds in this game are randomly generated so no two worlds are the same, so every time you start a new game you are guaranteed a completely different adventure.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#13;<\/p>\n<p>Explore endless worlds and build everything from the simplest house to the biggest castles.<\/p>\n<p>&#13;\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>The trial version of the most popular sandbox game<\/h3>\n<p>Although the full version of this sandbox game is paid, users can thanks <strong>Minecraft<\/strong> <strong>trial<\/strong> for a limited time alone or with friends from their smartphone and regardless of their location, take their first steps in things <strong>Crafting, exploring and building<\/strong> make.<\/p>\n<p>In the trial version, the user can explore infinite worlds and construct any imaginable building or structure with the available materials.
