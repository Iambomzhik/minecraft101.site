(games, parents)"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Hello dear parents,<br \/>Hello dear MC kids,<\/p>\n<p>I would like to briefly introduce our latest project and ourselves and hope that we can still win over one or the other.  It actually started from a &#8220;hobby post&#8221; here at GF, where someone (a grandpa) was looking for a server or information about a child-friendly Minecraft server for his grandchildren.  Then the thought came back to me 35+ (same father of 3 boys) &#8220;Man, you know the problem from somewhere&#8221; there might be a need for a child-friendly server network for some other parents, which one just builds up differently (with a few ideas). , present?  Because playing forever with dad or &#8220;grandpa&#8221; in this case is &#8220;boring&#8221;  <\/p>\n<p>Well what can I tell you, after I was allowed to write a post in the Minecraft Germany group (FaceBook) and got a huge wave of positive feedback from other parents, I was able to find a like-minded father (also 35+) with the same Thoughts with which I am now implementing the idea with the help of a sponsoring partner.<\/p>\n<p>A suitable website (forum) with some tips, rules and a description of our project are also in the works, the servers themselves are already in the starting blocks.<\/p>\n<p>In our network, children should not be able to &#8220;independently&#8221; try to get an entry on the whitelist (lack of control), but rather the parents. <\/p>\n<p>We are parents ourselves and also &#8220;online gamblers&#8221;, however, <strong>we find that far too many parents are not interested in what (FSK) or how long their children play something on the Internet (online). <\/strong>Minecraft is the most harmless game that is available &#8220;online&#8221;, unfortunately the community is not easy and therefore unfortunately often casts a bad light on the game, especially through many Youtube projects.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We want that and much more with our idea behind minecraft-kids.online <\/strong>in relation to Minecraft<strong> change<\/strong>because whoever is interested (in his children) <strong>to whom it is important what their child is up to and where, that their child (and oneself) does not have their pocket money pulled out of their pants with &#8220;cosmetic bells and whistles&#8221; from xyz-HD \/ ab++ft and Co. servers! <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We are even in the process of having a plugin developed where a player is given a &#8220;daily playing time&#8221; (by his parents) and the plugin then automatically blocks the player from our server when he has &#8220;reached his daily playing time with us &#8220;.  Can then only &#8220;gamble with us&#8221; again the next day.<\/p>\n<h4>Would you let your child play on such a network and does that sound interesting to some of you?<\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hello dear parents,Hello dear MC kids, I would like to briefly introduce our latest project and ourselves and hope that <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":55,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/252"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=252"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/252\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/55"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=252"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=252"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=252"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
