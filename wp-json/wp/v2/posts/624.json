Nevertheless, Minecraft is extremely successful and is available in various versions for almost all major consoles as well as mobile devices. However, the most complex version is still the PC version, which will also be reflected in the price in the future. So Mojang announced that the prices for the PC version of Minecraft will be increased. Accordingly, from May 23, 2016, Minecraft will no longer cost just under 20 euros, but 24 euros (instead of 19.95 euros soon 23.95 euros). The versions for the consoles or smartphones remain unchanged in their prices.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"ngg-singlepic ngg-none aligncenter jetpack-lazy-image\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654864237_274_Minecraft-\u2013-PC-version-is-getting-more-expensive.jpg\" alt=\"Minecraft - The 3 Little Pigs\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As a reason for the price increase, Mojang stated that they wanted to counteract the fluctuating exchange rates and adjust the prices to the dollar price. Attached there was a list showing the price changes worldwide. Well, I don&#8217;t really like such raises, especially in a game that generates extremely high sales figures and anyway makes huge profits. In the end, Minecraft is definitely worth 24 euros, but considering the further development of the game over the last few years, I don&#8217;t see why you should charge more money for the same game just because you can. Minecraft has lost its magic for me, I&#8217;ve always wished for an expansion of the AI, but I don&#8217;t have to talk about that again. For everyone who has always wanted to buy Minecraft, the next few days could still strike, because from Monday the game will be a little more expensive.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"ngg-singlepic ngg-none aligncenter jetpack-lazy-image\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654864237_978_Minecraft-\u2013-PC-version-is-getting-more-expensive.jpg\" alt=\"Minecraft - price list for the PC version 2016\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><\/h3>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Minecraft will cost a little more on Monday.
