After that day, the game will disappear from all stores;  in many, however, it is already gone.  That was it for the Xbox 360 store until it was for <strong>99.99 euros per episode<\/strong> suddenly resurrected.  Yep, zombie minecraft story mode is so expensive with 8 episodes will a half decent laptop.

But if the game is not offered at all, nobody can download it.  So what to do?  As it seems, the Xbox 360 store offered only one solution: the game needs to crawl back into the store, but so that no one grabs it, it now costs 800 euros for the entire package:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;In the process of removing these items for sale, on the Xbox 360 platform only, existing Minecraft: Story Mode players became unable to download their remaining episodes.  From working with the Xbox 360 platform, the only solution to this situation is to re-list the downloadable content for purchase.  So, to assist existing customers, all the downloadable Episodes for the two Minecraft: Story Mode titles are temporarily re-listed but, to deter new purchases, they will be re-listed at a very high price!&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655016808_913_800-euros-for-a-game-that-nobody-should-buy-is.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"\/><img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giga.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/2005-Telltale-Texas-Hold'em-rct200x210u.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"\/><\/p>\n<p>Start picture series(23 pictures)<\/p>\n<p>Telltale Games: All games at a glance!<\/p>\n<p>If you buy the game as a joke, you&#8217;ll have to pay almost 100 euros per episode &#8211; so keep your hands off.
