Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat are used by perpetrators, but also popular games such as &#8220;FIFA22&#8221; or &#8220;Minecraft&#8221;. <\/p>\n<p>According to a survey online, a quarter of all children and young people in Germany have been asked to go out on a date by adults.  24 percent of the more than 2,100 representative surveyed adolescents between the ages of 8 and 18 have already had this experience.<\/p>\n<p>And one in seven (14 percent) was asked by an adult to undress and turn on their webcam or smartphone camera.  This was the result of a survey commissioned by the State Media Authority of North Rhine-Westphalia.  The numbers are frightening, emphasized the director of the state institute, Tobias Schmid.<\/p>\n<p>In November, 2,163 children and young people between the ages of 8 and 18 were surveyed by the \u201cKB&#038;B Family Marketing Experts\u201d institute.  The focus was on so-called cybergrooming \u2013 contact between adults and minors with sexual intentions.  One in six adolescents (16 percent) said they had been promised something in return for a video or photo by an adult online contact.  And 15 percent said they were sent nude photos without being asked.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"o-headline\">Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat are used by perpetrators<\/h3>\n<p>Children and young people describe such experiences across all types of schools, with secondary school students or vocational school students being confronted with them more often.  There are no significant differences between girls and boys.  A look at the channels used shows that those affected receive sexualised speech primarily via Instagram, followed by WhatsApp and Snapchat &#8211; but also in online games such as &#8220;FIFA22&#8221; or &#8220;Minecraft&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>  also read <\/p><source data-breakpoint=\"Medium\" data-src-template=\"https:\/\/img.welt.de\/img\/wirtschaft\/webwelt\/mobile234828242\/1222507827-ci102l-wWIDTH\/Handy-und-schwarze-Hand-mit-Bundesadler-Symbolfoto-Staatstrojaner.jpg\" data- media=\"(min-width: 600px)\"><source data-breakpoint=\"Small\" data-src-template=\"https:\/\/img.welt.de\/img\/wirtschaft\/webwelt\/mobile234828242\/1222507827-ci102l-wWIDTH\/Handy-und-schwarze-Hand-mit-Bundesadler-Symbolfoto-Staatstrojaner.jpg\" data-><img style=\"background-image: url('https:\/\/www.welt.de\/assets\/images\/global\/welt_fallback-f924e6874c.gif');\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654349654_924_Via-Instagram-or-Minecraft-Many-children-contacted-online-with-sexual.jpg\" data-component=\"LazyLoad\" class=\"o-overlay c-placeholder__image\" data-qa=\"PictureElement.OriginalImage\" alt=\"Mobile phone and black hand with federal eagle, symbolic photo state trojan\"\/><\/source><\/source>                fight against child abuse       <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to protect children and young people from these attacks without restricting their freedom.
