More and more new updates bring a lot of variety into the game.  But mods are also very useful to make everything even more exciting&#8230;&#8230; But!  It would be very nice if there were even more options for designing NPCs.  And so the entry of commands becomes easier and clearer.  If the NPC&#8217;s can have changing texts or the NPC&#8217;s text will change when certain things are done&#8230; or something.  For better design of adventure maps.\n<\/p>\n<p>       <\/p>\n<h2 id=\"ios\">Minecraft &#8211; Pocket Edition: iOS App for iPhone and iPad<\/h2>\n<p>You can download version &#8220;1.18.12&#8221; of Minecraft &#8211; Pocket Edition for iPhone and iPad from the App Store.

Since I don&#8217;t have my own laptop that I would like to play it on, I switched to the mobile version about three years ago and am quite happy so far.  You have so many options and there is actually always something new to discover thanks to the numerous updates.  So far so good.  However, why there weren&#8217;t five \u2b50: There are several reasons for this, but the main reason is command blocks.  I&#8217;m more in creative than in survival and for good designs I sometimes have to use commands.  Personally, I&#8217;m very hiped on custom heads.  But while computer, playstation or whatever gamers can just copy and paste the command, mobile gamers have to type it out character by character.  And that&#8217;s really bad.  In addition, if you have made a mistake, you have to delete everything up to that point.  Conclusion: Minecraft is a great game, but there are a few things that mess it up.\n<\/p>\n<p>  <img src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654146528_863_Minecraft-Pocket-Edition-Download.png\" width=\"35\" height=\"35\" class=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple App Store\"\/>     <\/p>\n<p>The pixelated world of &#8220;Minecraft&#8221; invites you to build to your heart&#8217;s content and to discover an endlessly large world alone or together with others.

Everything consists of cube-shaped blocks.  Now it&#8217;s up to you what you want to do.  You can collect, mine or harvest any block in the world and then use it to build or craft something else.  There is no limit to your imagination.\n<\/p>\n<p>   <img src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Minecraft-Pocket-Edition-Download.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Finally, players of the Pocket and Windows 10 versions of Minecraft can get creative with the Redstone.\" class=\"lazy\"\/><br \/>\nFinally, players of the Pocket and Windows 10 versions of Minecraft can get creative with the Redstone.  (Source: Mojang)<\/p>\n<p>\nAfter launching the game, you can choose to play in Survival Mode or Creative Mode.  In survival mode, you are dropped in a randomly generated world and you have to make your way there.\n<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"ueberlebensmodus-minecraftpocket-edition\">Survival mode in Minecraft &#8211; Pocket Edition<\/h2>\n<p>A wide variety of characters and beings await you, who will either help you or make life a nightmare.  Crafting allows you to create tools and other items to help you survive or furnish your own home.  It is important to note that every block of the game world is degradable.  So you can create a world like you&#8217;ve always dreamed of.  Whether massive &#8220;terraforming&#8221; or a small hut in the forest &#8211; everything is possible.\n<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"kreativmodus-minecraftpocket-edition\">Creative mode in Minecraft &#8211; Pocket Edition<\/h2>\n<p>   <img src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654146528_763_Minecraft-Pocket-Edition-Download.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Minecraft on Xbox.\" class=\"lazy\"\/><br \/>\nMinecraft on Xbox.

Here you can fly over the landscape and have access to all items available in the game in an inventory selection.  So you can easily implement your ideas without having to worry about raw materials or the production of specific tools.  Plus, you&#8217;ll break down any block you&#8217;re aiming for with just a single hit.\n<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"mehrspieler-minecraftpocket-edition\">Multiplayer in Minecraft &#8211; Pocket Edition<\/h2>\n<p>So that you don&#8217;t have to roam around in the big Minecraft world all by yourself, there is the option of exploring Pixelland together with friends via a WLAN network.  The help from your friends will be very helpful to you.  Because in order to explore the depths of the caves where the greatest treasures await you, you have to be armed against all kinds of opponents.\n<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"fazit-minecraftpocket-edition\">Our verdict on Minecraft &#8211; Pocket Edition<\/h2>\n<p>You can finally play Minecraft on iOS or Android devices.  Although the Pocket Edition is still inferior to its twin on the PC in some functions, the basic structure is already recognizable and extensions are added to the app with every update.  However, the control via the touchpad is still a bit cumbersome.  The construction of large buildings can quickly become a test of patience.\n<\/p>\n<p>Minecraft &#8211; Pocket Edition is the ideal supplement for fans on the go.  Incidentally, the retro-look graphics look just as good on the smartphone as on the PC.  Maybe the app will soon be able to compete with the PC game in every aspect.  You can find similar games in our construction, economy and vehicle simulations.\n<\/p>\n<h2>Master Data of Minecraft &#8211; Pocket Edition<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"d-f fd-r fw-w no-ls fs-ms\">\n<li class=\"w-33 w-m-50 mb-10\"> <strong>Updated on<\/strong>\n<p>05\/05\/2022<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li class=\"w-33 w-m-50 mb-10\"> <strong>license<\/strong>\n<p>shareware<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li class=\"w-33 w-m-50 mb-10\"> <strong>Manufacturer<\/strong>\n<p>mojang\n<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li class=\"w-33 w-m-50 mb-10\"> <strong>language<\/strong>\n<p>German<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li class=\"w-33 w-m-50 mb-10\"> <strong>number of downloads<\/strong>\n<p>63,980<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li class=\"w-33 w-m-50 mb-10\"> <strong>main category<\/strong>  <\/li>\n<li class=\"w-33 w-m-50 mb-10\"> <strong>subcategory<\/strong>  <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Minecraft &#8211; Pocket Edition Download \u276f       <img src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Minecraft-Pocket-Edition-Download.svg.svg+xml\" alt=\"\" class=\"lazy\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p class=\"c-w fs-l fw-b mt-0 lh-12 mb-10\">Don&#8217;t miss anything with the NETZWELT newsletter<\/p>\n<p class=\"fs-ms mb-20 mt-0 lh-12\" style=\"color: #f8e0fb;\">Every Friday: The most informative and entertaining summary from the world of technology!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Now also to take away 05 May 2022 at 00:00 The pixelated world of &#8220;Minecraft&#8221; invites you to build to <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":180,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/174"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=174"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/174\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/180"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=174"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=174"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=174"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
