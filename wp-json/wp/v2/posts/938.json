Its original name is simply &#8220;Minecraft&#8221; (Chinese: \u6211\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u56fd\u7248), with a Creeper face on one character.  This Minecraft variant was specially produced for China because only access to Chinese shops, app stores and servers is allowed there.  The Minecraft manufacturer Mojang has entered into a partnership with the Chinese company NetEase, which has reprogrammed the game.\n<\/p>\n<h2>requirements[]<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You don&#8217;t need a Mojang account to play, you need a NetEase account.  The launcher also comes from NetEase.<\/li>\n<li>Registration for the NetEase account is only possible for Chinese people.  For this purpose, the real name, ID card number and telephone number are checked during the extensive registration process.  A verification code will be sent to the phone number via SMS.  The form can only be filled out in the original language, if it appears translated it will not work.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Characteristics[]<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This edition is free because there are already a lot of free illegal Minecraft versions in the Chinese app stores[1].<\/li>\n<li>The NetEase launcher has a built-in download facility, similar to the marketplace.  There are not only resource and skin packs available for download, but also modifications.  The offers come from the community.  Some offers are free, some are paid.  Some things you pay for with diamonds, which you have to buy (similar to Minecraft coins), for others with emeralds, which you get if you go online every day.<\/li>\n<li>The launcher also has an integrated friends system.<\/li>\n<li>The game cannot be started in offline mode.<\/li>\n<li>A version number is not displayed in the game.<\/li>\n<li>The game is playable on PC (Java) and mobile devices (Android and iOS).<\/li>\n<li>The adjustments to the Java Edition are made through modifications, the Modloader Forge and some modifications (including OptiFine) are automatically integrated.<\/li>\n<li>There is no language selection, Chinese is fixed.<\/li>\n<li>Steve and Alex skins are free, additional skins are paid.<\/li>\n<li>The worlds are not stored locally, but in the NetEase cloud.<\/li>\n<li>The multiplayer mode is possible in LAN, with the paid Minecraft Realms or with some predetermined servers.<\/li>\n<li>There is no progression in the Bedrock Edition.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>National Animal Vote[]<\/h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Minecraft China Creature Vote.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"266\" data-image-name=\"Minecraft China Kreaturenabstimmung.png\" data-image-key=\"Minecraft_China_Kreaturenabstimmung.png\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655294052_16_Minecraft-China-Minecraft-Wiki.png\" class=\"lazyload\"\/><\/p>\n<p>From September 7th to 20th, 2018 there was a vote for Minecraft China[2], which is one of five national animals of China to be included in Minecraft.
