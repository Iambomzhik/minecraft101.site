Only the PS4 version is not compatible.<\/p>\n<p>Friends playing on PC, Xbox One or mobile can now team up with Switch owners to build and explore Minecraft worlds together.  However, thanks to Sony&#8217;s &#8220;walled garden&#8221; approach to online gaming, players with a PlayStation 4 will not be able to plug into their friends&#8217; Switch sessions.<\/p>\n<p>Those who already own the Minecraft game for Nintendo Switch will need to download an entirely new version from Nintendo eShop, simply called Minecraft.  However, it is completely free for anyone who owns the older game.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise it&#8217;s \u00a319.99 on the eShop itself, or you can buy a physical copy &#8211; the Bedrock Edition with included Super Mario mash-up skins etc &#8211; for \u00a324.95 from Amazon.co.uk and other retailers.<\/p>\n<p>You need a Nintendo Switch Online account to play the game with your friends over the internet.  This is currently free, but will become a paid subscription service starting in September.  You can find out more about the service, including pricing, here: What is Nintendo Switch Online, how much does it cost and when is it coming?<\/p>\n<p>Minecraft isn&#8217;t the first cross-platform game for the Switch that Sony doesn&#8217;t support.  The recently released Fortnite also features cross-play with other formats besides PS4.<\/p>\n<p>                Writing by Rick Henderson.
