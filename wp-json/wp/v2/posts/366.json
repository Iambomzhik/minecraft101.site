As a father of 3 boys myself, I know the problem well enough, you can&#8217;t really let a 6-12 year old &#8220;play Minecraft online&#8221; without there being a theater or you try to get the kids money out of their pockets with &#8220;cosmetic frills and ranks&#8221;. to pull.<\/p>\n<p><u style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><b style=\"background-color: #fefefe; color: #141414; font-size: 16px;\">The idea:<\/b><\/u><br style=\"background-color: #fefefe; color: #141414; font-size: 16px;\" \/>A server (network) for small children (approx. 6-12 years) speak for the young Minecrafters and their parents, grandparents or friends. We only want the little ones to come onto the server if one of the parents has given their consent (a brief parent-teacher meeting in advance). Parents have to &#8220;introduce themselves&#8221; to us together with their children and parents who are not necessarily familiar with Minecraft (servers) are introduced a little and they know where their child is &#8220;on the internet&#8221;.<br style=\"background-color: #fefefe; color: #141414; font-size: 16px;\" \/><strong>No PaytoWin, ranks, currencies, real money rip off or unfair voting system<\/strong>which the little ones usually don&#8217;t understand anyway or may not be allowed to use, <strong>no YouTuber ranks<\/strong> or &#8220;Youtuber&#8221; on the server. We&#8217;re supposed to be all about the Minecraft game and having fun together.<\/p>\n<p>One of our self-developed plugins monitors the playtime of a child&#8217;s Minecraft account, so (if the parents so wish) you could give the child a<b style=\"font-size: 16px; background-color: #fefefe; color: #141414;\"> set daily &#8220;multimedia time&#8221; on our servers for children.<\/b> Which does ______________ mean; if someone has been allocated 2 hours of playing time, they can use it freely, but if the time is used up, they &#8220;stop gambling with us&#8221;. Unfortunately, we cannot prevent switching to other networks&#8230; but we can ensure that the times are adhered to with us.<br \/>\nDepending on the server concept, there are different classic modes; <strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Creative servers (plots), survival (freebuild) servers with NPCs and barter and themed cities (biomes) with some RP because our NPCs talk to you, city build (plots) with up to 4 plots or a mega plot, skyblock and mini-games and much more<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A lot of things on the servers are animated (a GUI) using the game menu and symbols to make getting started as easy as possible. Bedrock players with Nintendo Switch, Xbox, tablet (iPad and Co.) and smartphone can also play on our servers thanks to the &#8220;Gyser&#8221; software. Unfortunately, Playstation players are currently and will not be possible in the future, but this is due to the console manufacturer Sony.<\/p>\n<p><br style=\"background-color: #fefefe; color: #141414; font-size: 16px;\" \/>Our team members who look after the kids are checked for authenticity via proof of identification (Post-Ident) and get our terms of use to sign to keep people with false backgrounds away. Nobody can follow Mr.X after the child has fallen into the well&#8230;safety is our top priority here, we don&#8217;t want to take care of the children. Anyone who has nothing to hide and wants to be sure that their children are in good hands will certainly understand. In the kindergarten, school or youth center, people don&#8217;t run around with a bag over their heads.<\/p>\n<p>A suitable website and Facebook group are currently in the works. Everyone can get an idea of \u200b\u200bour project (and us) there. You can contact us via Discord or the contact form. Optionally, we also offer telephone support with an appointment.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time for this (small) contribution and I look forward to supporters of our project or positive criticism \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hello dear parents,Hello dear MC kids,I would like to briefly introduce our latest project and ourselves and hope that we <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":367,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/366"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=366"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/366\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1790,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/366\/revisions\/1790"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/367"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=366"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=366"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=366"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
