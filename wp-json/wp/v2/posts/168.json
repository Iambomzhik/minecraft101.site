It has been around for over ten years and is played by millions of people across a variety of devices.  It has also spawned additional titles of its own and has various game\/story modes for users to play in.<\/p>\n<p>Despite all of this, Microsoft still offers a free Minecraft trial for anyone unsure if the game is for them.  This trial version is available for both the Java edition and the Windows Store version of Minecraft.  The free trial offers enough in terms of gameplay to give users an idea of \u200b\u200bhow the game works.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"rb-minecraft-java-edition-kostenlose-testversion\">Minecraft Java Edition Free Trial<\/h2>\n<p>To get those <strong>Minecraft Java Edition Free<\/strong> version, you need to create a free account with Mojang.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit the <strong>official Minecraft website<\/strong> Here.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Click Sign In<\/strong> top right.<\/li>\n<li>press the <strong>Sign up for the free option.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Sign up for a new account<\/strong> and check it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Once you create a free Minecraft account, you can download Minecraft free trial.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"rb-kostenlose-testversion-von-minecraft-java-edition-herunterladen\">Download Minecraft Java Edition Free Trial<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit the<strong> official Minecraft website and sign in with your account.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>On the home page, <strong>Click Games in the top bar.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Select Minecraft.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>click <strong>Try it for free<\/strong> above.<\/li>\n<li>Scroll down and click <strong>Download now.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Run the installer<\/strong> and you can play the game for free.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-399486\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654129207_299_How-to-Get-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Free-Download-Trial.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"688\"\/><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"rb-minecraft-java-edition-einschrankungen-der-kostenlosen-testversion\">Minecraft Java Edition Free Trial Limitations<\/h3>\n<p>All free trials have limitations;  these can be in the form of constrained or time-based functions.  In the case of Minecraft, you get a mix of both.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A user with the free trial of Minecraft Java Edition cannot join a multiplayer server.<\/li>\n<li>You can play for a total of 1 hour and 40 minutes, meaning you can spend 5 days in a Minecraft world.<\/li>\n<li>You can only play in survival mode.  Creative mode and hardcore mode are not available.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"rb-fazit\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Minecraft free trial is also available for Playstation and Android.  The trial versions are not linked, so you can try the app\/game separately on each platform for free before you buy it.  As for the price.  Minecraft doesn&#8217;t really change its price.  The desktop version has consistently sold for around $30 for years with the exception of the 10th anniversary.  You should try the version you plan to buy to get a good idea of \u200b\u200bhow well the game works.  For example, if you want to buy the Java version instead of the Windows Store version, try the Java version.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Minecraft is one of the most popular open world games today.
