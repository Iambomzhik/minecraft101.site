But now I&#8217;m wondering how it is&#8230; of course you do it in such a way that the person can still breathe.  But don&#8217;t talk and close your eyes all the time?<\/p>\n<p>My questions:<\/p>\n<p>1. Sometimes I&#8217;m a bit excited&#8230; and that&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t keep my eyes open all the time xD Sure, it might be different in the mornings at school, but still.  What if you opened your eyes?  Would anything happen there?  Would that be bad?  \ud83d\ude2e Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t know my way around that well <img src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655857209_209_Plaster-Masks-God-the-World-Terraconia.png\" class=\"smiley\" alt=\":\/\" height=\"23\"  title=\"unsure\"\/><\/p>\n<p>2. How long does something have to stay on it?  So for most of them it took about 40 minutes&#8230; (I also made the mask for one xD) But does it really take about that long or longer?  Or even..shorter?<\/p>\n<p>3. When can the mask be removed?  We were told that if it gets warm we can make faces under the mask and then take it off after a little while&#8230; but depending on where you started it probably gets warm in different places at different times, right?<\/p>\n<p>4. And with that the last question:<br \/>How does that feel roughly?  Is it possible to test in advance with any means how that is?<\/p>\n<p>I look forward to your answers <img src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Plaster-Masks-God-the-World-Terraconia.png\" class=\"smiley\" alt=\"^^\" height=\"23\"  title=\"grin\"\/><\/p>\n<p>LG LoraMC<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>hey, Since we are making plaster masks at school right now, I have a few questions if anyone here has <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1433,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1432"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1432"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1432\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1433"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1432"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1432"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1432"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
