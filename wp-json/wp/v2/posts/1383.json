No me neither, but luckily someone else is and uploaded the whole thing to YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>Speedrunner FrozenMelody did it in 33 minutes and 35 seconds to be exact.  The content creator completed the challenge even without audio assistance, showing an impressive memory of the route.  He gives himself about six minutes to collect items and then four minutes to act before setting off in a boat on the second day of the in-game run.  He arrives at The End around 17 minutes before setting a trap and fighting the Ender Dragon.<\/p>\n<p>FrozenMelody explains that he built the route to be as safe as possible and reproducible by anyone with the mental bandwidth to remember it.  Of course, RNG can still affect the run, but input errors are all you have to worry about.  FrozenMelody says it has &#8220;100+ clips&#8221; of failed runs as &#8220;any little thing could go wrong&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to describe how many small millisecond changes can cause the run to fail,&#8221; he says.  &#8220;Wrong clicked?  Failed.  Letting go of a direction too soon?  Failed.  Did you take an unwanted item with you?  Failed.  Villagers push you?  Failed.  Kill the dragon and land in the middle of the last portal and not jump into the credits one block in each direction from you before you take off the blindfold?  Yes, that hurt a lot.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>FrozenMelody also thinks his time is pretty beatable as he was &#8220;terribly lucky&#8221; with the kite which cost him around six minutes.  Here&#8217;s the run:<\/p>\n<p> <img width=\"100%\"\/><\/p>\n<p>FrozenMelody&#8217;s channel also has tons of other blindfolded speedruns in games like Deltarune and Celeste if you fancy watching more videos.<\/p>\n<p>The first part of Minecraft&#8217;s Caves &#038; Cliffs was released earlier this year, although you&#8217;ll have to wait until the holiday season for the other part.
