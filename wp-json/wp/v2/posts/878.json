If your answer is yes, it is worth reading this MiniTool post carefully.  This article will tell you whether you should go for Windows 10 or the Java version from different aspects.<\/p>\n<p>Quick navigation :<\/p>\n<ul class=\"article-nav-list\">\n<li>introduction<\/li>\n<li>Minecraft Windows 10 compared to Java<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"einf\u00fchrung-1279\">introduction<\/h2>\n<p>Minecraft was originally a game based on Java until Microsoft bought it.  The Java version is still active, but since Minecraft is a popular game title, using it as a UWP app is a good way to promote these types of apps.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of functionality, Minecraft Windows 10 is similar to the Java version.  We refer to the various items that appear in the game, monsters and biomes, and its general mechanics by function.  That said, there are differences between the games and they affect the gameplay to a large extent.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>-Image from minecraft.net<\/p>\n<p>So which is the best version of Minecraft?  Minecraft Windows 10 or the original Java?  It&#8217;s not easy to conclude, but you&#8217;re able to get some clues after reading the comparison between the two versions.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"minecraft-windows-10-verglichen-mit-java-1279\">Minecraft Windows 10 compared to Java<\/h2>\n<p>The comparison between Minecraft Windows 10 and the Java version mainly includes six aspects.  They are Mods, Cost, Controllers, Crossplay, Server and System Resource Usage.  I will now explain them to you one by one<\/p>\n<h3>mods:<\/h3>\n<p>Two versions of Minecraft support mods.  That is, since the release of the Java version of 2010, there are more mods in the first version than in the Windows 10 version of 2015. Objectively speaking, the quality of the Java mode is higher than the standard of Minecraft Windows 10 mods.<\/p>\n<p>After all, the original edition of the Windows 10 version was designed for mobile devices, so the modded scene will always catch up.<\/p>\n<h3>Costs:<\/h3>\n<p>The Java version is \u00a317.95 in the UK, while the Windows 10 version is \u00a322.49 on the Windows Store.<\/p>\n<p>But there is one more small thing.  The Java version is fully playable, complete with mods, textures, and all other content associated with Minecraft, without paying a penny.  Although you can download all of the above variants in Windows 10 for free, this version also comes with optional in-game purchases.<\/p>\n<p>These items range from map packs, textures, skins and new game modes.  Most people will definitely balk at the idea of \u200b\u200bpaying for addons in Minecraft, but it&#8217;s a risk-free approach for parents since Windows 10&#8217;s third-party content has been verified by Microsoft.<\/p>\n<h3>controller:<\/h3>\n<p>Both versions support mice and keyboards, but only one of them supports controllers.  Although Mojang was released in 2010, it has not yet implemented the Java version of the controller support.<\/p>\n<p>For most PC-centric gamers this won&#8217;t be a problem, but if you want to jump out of the darkness of console gaming onto PC, you&#8217;ll need to install an additional program like Joy ToKey to get a controller.<\/p>\n<p>For the Windows 10 version, you plug in a controller and it works.  Even if you don&#8217;t use the controller feature, in this case more features is better than less.<\/p>\n<h3>Crossplay:<\/h3>\n<p>With the Windows version, anyone can play with players on other devices including Xbox, Android, IOS and the Nintendo Switch in June.  To play with other players, you must create a free Xbox Live account.  Since this feature is not available for the Java version, the Windows 10 version of Minecraft has an absolute advantage.<\/p>\n<h3>Server:<\/h3>\n<p>Both versions have servers.  The only problem is that we are using two different versions of the same game &#8211; the Java version can&#8217;t connect to the Windows 10 server while Windows 10 can&#8217;t connect to the Java version&#8217;s server.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, the most important point when choosing a version is to see which has more servers that you like.<\/p>\n<h3>System resource consumption:<\/h3>\n<p>The Java version of Minecraft is more resource intensive than the Windows 10 version.  This is more of a Java issue than a Minecraft issue.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because the Java version of Minecraft is a full application, while the Windows 10 version is a Minecraft PE or mobile application.  You will find that Java Minecraft is not that resource intensive if you compare it with other full application games like Fortenite, Apex Legends, Creativerse, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not want to modify the game further, it is better to use the Windows 10 version.<\/p>\n<p>This is the entire content of <strong>Minecraft Java Edition vs Windows 10<\/strong>.
