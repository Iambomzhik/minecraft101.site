Get web content comfortably on the TV, shop and play &#8211; for some a small Garden of Eden!  But which games should you try first?  Do you absolutely need a controller or is the remote control enough?  Are there also multiplayer games?  We introduce you to games that you should definitely not miss.\n<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>The Fire TV as a game console<\/h2>\n<p>In the following we limit ourselves to Android games that are available in the Amazon app store.  In principle, however, it is possible to retrofit and install other Android games for the Fire TV.  Since the games can usually be controlled with a controller, remote control or smartphone, which can be conveniently connected via Bluetooth, nothing stands in the way of a spontaneous multiplayer game in the living room.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/10-games-you-should-know.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"\/><img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655441062_933_10-games-you-should-know.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"\/><\/p>\n<p>Start picture series(12 pictures)<\/p>\n<p>Download Amazon Fire TV apps: You should not do without these apps<\/p>\n<p>Many of the games are offered free of charge, although it should be said that you sometimes have to pay extra to unlock higher levels or multiplayer mode.  If you want to buy a Fire TV game controller, you can get some of the games for free and others for a reduced price.  If you already have an Xbox 360 controller, you can easily connect it to the Fire TV.  Even if operation with the remote control should be possible for many games &#8211; in reality the device is not always suitable for mastering all situations in the game.<\/p>\n<p><i class=\"icon-angle-right\"\/>Buy the Amazon Fire TV Game Controller here<\/p>\n<h2>Beautiful stories, excellent graphics, racing, fighting, retro &#8211; games for every taste on the Amazon Fire TV<\/h2>\n<h3>1. Machinarium<\/h3>\n<p>The adventure from the Czech Amanita Design Studios is characterized above all by the artistically outstanding animation.  The hand-drawn characters and backgrounds, together with the successful soundtrack composition, create a truly enchanting atmosphere.  The tasks to be solved do not always correspond to the typical point&#038;click adventure &#8211; there are many logic puzzles to be solved, the dialogues are short, kept in comic style and play more of a secondary role.  Warning: While the game is advertised as playable with the Fire TV remote, it cannot be played through without a controller.  The remote control is simply not suitable for certain moves &#8211; such as fast cycling.  Nevertheless, the rusty world of the little robot Josef is worth an entertaining journey and Machinarium is one of the ten most beautiful tablet games of all time!  However, if you want to save the world and robot friend Berta, you have to pay for Machinarium.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour<\/h3>\n<p>If you like first-person shooters and have the confidence to save the world after a nuclear attack, you&#8217;ve come to the right place.  Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour is paid, but Gameloft convinces with console-quality graphics.  Anyone who appreciates ingenious stories will not really get their money&#8217;s worth with this game &#8211; but excitement, fun and action are guaranteed.  You can play lone fighter campaigns or compete with others in a variety of modes using the online multiplayer function: in addition to the classic deathmatch, you can also save VIPs or try to keep a flag as long as possible.  Small downer: For really good weapons you have to actually dig into your pocket again and use real money.<\/p>\n<p> <img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655441063_715_10-games-you-should-know.png\" alt=\"Amazon Fire TV Games\" title=\"\"\/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Asphalt 8: Airborne<\/h3>\n<p>Also from Gameloft, this game convinces with first-class graphics for racing games.  Since Asphalt 8: Airborne is available for free on Fire TV, you can&#8217;t go wrong and give it a try.  However, if you don&#8217;t want to become an Android in-app junkie, you have to be prepared that the fun may be short-lived.  You can achieve relatively little in the game without spending extra money on better cars, for example.  Not only is this annoying, it can also be outrageously expensive.  So you can sometimes get prices of around 80\u20ac for your virtual cars.  In addition, the game is quite large and requires over 1 GB of storage space &#8211; which is of course significant given the current total capacity of 8 GB, but will be less of a problem in the future when Amazon has installed the announced update and you can expand the space using a mass storage device.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655441063_409_10-games-you-should-know.jpg\" alt=\"Fire TV Games Airborne 8\" title=\"\"\/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic<\/h3>\n<p>Not cheap either, but this Aspyr classic is beautiful.  Anyone who already knows the game from the PC will not be disappointed with this version &#8211; a must for all role-playing and Star Wars fans.  For less than \u20ac10 you get at least 30 hours of gameplay, which is more than the average playing time of most Fire TV games.  The required storage space is quite small at the beginning, but in the course of the game you have to be able to load more than 2 GB of data.  If you&#8217;re looking to adventure, shape your character, and explore distant planets, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is an investment you&#8217;ll definitely enjoy.  If you have already played the game on the Xbox 360, you might benefit from the fact that you can also connect the controller of this game console to the Fire TV.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655441063_846_10-games-you-should-know.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Fire TV Games\" title=\"\"\/><\/p>\n<h3>5.Minecraft: Pocket Edition<\/h3>\n<p>Minecraft is so popular that everyone has probably at least heard of it &#8211; so the Fire TV version shouldn&#8217;t be missing either.  Minecraft by Mojang is a creative open world game.  The different landscape types &#8211; deserts, mountains, forests, etc. &#8211; consist of blocks that you can remove and place as you wish.  You are able to create fascinating buildings and create the world with paths, ports and cities according to your own ideas.  Minecraft: Pocket Edition is, as the name suggests, a scaled-down world &#8211; so gameplay options are more limited than the computer versions.  Beginners will certainly not be affected by this at first.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655441063_209_10-games-you-should-know.jpg\" alt=\"Fire tv games minecraft\" title=\"\"\/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>On the next page you will see even more games worth knowing about!<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the Fire TV, Amazon has succeeded in bringing a playground for adults into the living room.
