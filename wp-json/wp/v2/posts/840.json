There are no limits to your imagination, you can collect blocks made of different materials to create whatever your heart desires.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you are able to build a house out of larger blocks of stone, by chopping down trees you build the furniture for your house, but you can also create more complex structures such as shafts, statues, etc.  If you try it out for the first time, you will quickly realize that the game offers practically endless possibilities.<\/p>\n<p>But constructing buildings is only part of Minecraft.  The other part comes at nightfall when the monsters come out of their cages and the game mutates into a true survival horror game.  You have to take on giant spiders, skeletons, endermen and other creatures.  Here you have to use sword, bow and arrow skillfully.<\/p>\n<p>Survival in Minecraft requires more than just a home with a bed, a sword, and a few tools.  You also have to take care of food as soon as the character gets hungry.  The best materials aren&#8217;t always in the immediate vicinity, so you have to do a bit of environmental scouting.  Sooner or later you have to take advantage of the many freedoms that the game has to offer.<\/p>\n<p>Visually, Minecraft isn&#8217;t a marvel, as can be seen from the images, but the grid-like graphics make a lot of sense for a game like this.  You also have the option of radically adapting the graphics with the help of mods and skins.<\/p>\n<p>Minecraft is one of the most successful indie games to come out in recent times, and not without reason.  Notch&#8217;s masterpiece has captured the hearts of millions of gamers and is now available for all major platforms: iOS, Android, Xbox 360, Linux, Mac and of course Windows.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Minecraft is an adventure game in which you can let your creativity run free in a world full of blocks <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":841,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/840"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=840"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/840\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/841"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=840"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=840"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=840"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
