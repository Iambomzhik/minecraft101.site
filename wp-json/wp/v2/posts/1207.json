I&#8217;m not sure if you&#8217;re planning on going to PC or console, but multiplayer servers aren&#8217;t always conducive to young kids.  There is only one multiplayer server which I would like to say is ok for young children but I would still recommend that parents play with the children because the rules of the server are very strong from the moderators but be compassionately enforced. <\/p>\n<p>    Otherwise, minecraft is a great game for people of all ages.  It&#8217;s up to you to find out if your child can handle the scariest monsters like creepers.  The game&#8217;s graphics don&#8217;t make them particularly scary, but I&#8217;ve been playing the game for years and I still jump when a creeper unexpectedly appears behind me.  If you don&#8217;t think your kids will do well with this, you can set the difficulty to peaceful, which will not only stop the aggressive mobs from spawning, but will also stop you from getting hungry and starving.  Plus, when you play in creative mode, you and your kids can build almost anything you can think of.  Have fun with it! <\/p>\n<p>    If you are playing with more than one child I would give them the opportunity to build their own houses that have enough room for expansion.  That way they can have their own material, their own space, and you don&#8217;t have to deal with arguments about whose material belongs to whom.  In addition, they can express their own style preferences.  Make yourself a house too and let them suggest\/help build! <\/p>\n<p>    Have fun and PM me if you have any further questions. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you can do without multiplayer servers, that would probably be for the best.
