The game offers PC users two versions &#8211; a Windows 10 version and a Java version.  Gamers can install a popular version on the computer according to their preferences.  These two versions have similar features.  But there are still some differences between these two versions and the gaming experience is also different.  The Java version was released in 2010 while the Windows 10 version was released in 2015.  Therefore, you can learn the differences between Windows 10 edition and Java edition first.  After that, you decide which version to buy.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>Comparison of Minecraft Windows 10 and Java version<\/h2>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to experience all the differences.  Below we have listed eight major differences.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Costs:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Minecraft Java Edition currently costs \u20ac23.95 per year.  The Windows 10 version costs \u20ac29.99 per year.  The Windows 10 version is comparatively expensive.  The Java edition still includes the mods, the textures and everything else you can use in Minecraft.  You don&#8217;t need to pay for the other content either.  But this is different with the Windows 10 version.  Gamers still have to buy the mods, textures and other content individually.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want any extra cost for the mods, the textures and the other content, the Java version is suitable for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>mods:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Both Java Edition and Windows 10 Edition support the mods and the texture packs.  Because the Java version was released earlier than the Windows 10 version.  The Java version was better supported by the mod developers.  The popular shaders, which can visually enhance the game, are only available in the Java version.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to use this content in the Windows 10 version, you still have to buy the skins, texture packs and worlds separately.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Performance and Stability:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Performance and stability are computer dependent.  The minimum requirements of the Minecraft Windows 10 version are Celeron J4105 in conjunction with the Intel HD Graphics 4000 and 4 GB RAM, while the Java version requires a powerful computer.  On a weaker PC or laptop, the performance and stability of the Java version can be very poor.  If you want to install Minecraft on office laptop, Java version is not suitable for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Crossplay:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Java version only supports playing Minecraft with the other Java players.  But the Windows 10 version does not have this limitation.  This means that with the Windows 10 version, players can still play with other platforms such as Xbox, Playstation, Android and iOS under Windows 10.  Minecraft Windows 10 version players only need an Xbox Live account.  Compared to the Java version, the Windows 10 version is more user-friendly in this case.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Controllers:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Java edition and Windows 10 edition support mouse and keyboard, but Java edition does not support controller.  For the Java version, if you want to use the controller, you still need to install a program like JoyTokey on your computer.  With the Windows 10 version, it&#8217;s much easier.  Players only need to connect a controller to the computer, then they can play Minecraft with the controller.<\/p>\n<p>If you prefer to play Minecraft with the controller, the Windows 10 version is suitable for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sever:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Both versions have servers.  But they use different servers.  The Java version and the Windows 10 version can only connect to their own servers.  Compared to the Windows 10 version, the Java version has more servers.  You can choose the version you want according to the number of servers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Graphics:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This also depends on your computer.  The Java version is not suitable for a weaker computer.  The render distance is reduced.  The huge worlds take longer to load and the game may crash on the weaker computer.  If you don&#8217;t have a powerful computer, the Windows 10 version is suitable for you.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to use the realistic textures, exquisite lighting and real water physics in Minecraft, you should install Java version until Super Duper Graphics Pack is available in Windows 10 version.<\/p>\n<h2>Install a high-performance hard drive in the computer<\/h2>\n<p>A new and powerful hard drive can also improve your gaming experience.  Many gamers have a second or third hard drive built into their computer.  You can save not only Minecraft but also many other games on the new hard drive.<\/p>\n<p>The new hard disk cannot be used directly after installation.  You still need to set up the new hard disk, for example, initialize the new hard disk, allocate space, etc. If you want to make this setup easy and quick, we can recommend professional but easy-to-use disk management software.<\/p>\n<p>EaseUS Partition Master offers you the all-in-one disk management solutions.  With the software, you can merge, shrink, extend, format partitions, clone disk and partition, migrate system, etc. Now download the software and start setup.<\/p>\n<p><i class=\"iconfont org\">\ue611<\/i>100% clean <i class=\"iconfont org\">\ue64c<\/i>No adware<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 1.<\/strong> Launch EaseUS Partition Master. <\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Launch EaseUS Partition Master\" height=\"468\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654571363_969_Minecraft-Windows-10-or-Java-Edition.png\" width=\"700\"\/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2.<\/strong> The program will automatically detect the new SSD.
