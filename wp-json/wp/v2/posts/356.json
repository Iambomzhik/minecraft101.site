This is especially true for young children.  If you&#8217;re thinking of introducing your kids to coding, you might want to try learning to code games for kids.  From Scratch to Minecraft, here&#8217;s our list of the top contenders for your kid&#8217;s coding teacher spot!<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Programming in a nutshell<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard by now that in some way coding is perfect for kids and their education from a young age.  We can&#8217;t but agree &#8211; programming is the 21st century skill that creates a completely different, empowering relationship with technology and fosters diverse skills such as reasoning, communication, creativity and even math skills.  We already talked about the myriad benefits of coding in a previous blog post. <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>So we&#8217;ve already established why programming itself is so incredibly useful for your kids.  The sooner they pick up the basics of programming (like any other language), the better the chances they&#8217;ll learn quickly and absorb it naturally.  If you&#8217;re still wondering how to go about it because you might not be a programming expert yourself, we have a useful suggestion for you \u2013 <strong>Games to learn programming for kids<\/strong>.  But why programming games at all?<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Learning to code games for kids &#8211; why these are good educational tools<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>On our blog we have already discussed why learning through play is so practical for children.  You can find the article here.  In summary, learning through play is very natural for children.  They experiment, tinker, observe, design and build with their previous experiences without realizing it.  Learning through play mimics real-world problem solving for little ones.  Play makes the learning process smoother and more fun than sitting at a desk listening to a lecture.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654443501_862_10-games-to-learn-programming-for-kids.jpeg\" alt=\"Learning to code games for kids - why these are good educational tools\"\/><\/p>\n<p>Another reason why games for kids to learn to code are a good idea is that <strong>storytelling<\/strong> of games.  Storytelling is another learning environment that children enjoy and are used to, as we have also discussed here.  For example, at <strong>Robo prodigy <\/strong>all programming lessons built around creative stories, which engages children&#8217;s minds and humanizes learning.  Engaging storytelling draws children into the storyline and allows them to relate to the characters.  Stories can also promote understanding and create an environment in which the child feels comfortable, relaxed, and open to new information. <\/p>\n<h4><strong>Top 10 Learning Coding Games for Kids to Try<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>So what programming games for kids meet these criteria of engaging storytelling and well-structured game-based education?  We have made a list of 10 notable games.  We&#8217;ve discussed benefits as well as age appropriateness so you can choose the best games for your kids or students to learn to code. <\/p>\n<h4><strong>1.
