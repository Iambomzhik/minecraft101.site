Regardless of whether the child is under or over 13 years old, they can play mini-games like Counter Blox &#8211; a sort of Roblox version of the well-known shooter game Counter-Strike.  There is no separate age rating for the games within \u201cRoblox\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>So-called &#8220;account restrictions&#8221; can be selected in the account settings.  These can be made on the website and are updated on all end devices on which &#8220;Roblox&#8221; is installed.  When restrictions are enabled, only games from a select list that have been approved and curated as youth-friendly by the provider can be played.  User-created games in which content unsuitable for children can be found can no longer be played with the restrictions.  The use of the &#8220;Roblox Studio&#8221; remains unaffected.  Account restrictions also disable Roblox interactions like private messaging or in-game chats.<\/p>\n<p>If access to all user-generated games is not to be restricted, settings can be made manually: &#8220;Roblox&#8221; has a useful feature called &#8220;Age Visibility&#8221; that can be used to set age-appropriate settings for children. The online game also has a central dashboard to restrict chat functions, for example.<\/p>\n<p>Parents can choose a PIN in the Roblox account settings, which is always necessary to change a setting, so that the account restrictions cannot be overridden by the children themselves.  Parents can find detailed instructions on account restrictions here. <\/p>\n<p>Some settings can also be made in the games on &#8220;Roblox&#8221; itself and then only relate specifically to the respective game.  In some games, the visibility of blood or killed avatars can be switched off. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Roblox Security Settings It is often not easy for parents to control how Roblox is used: users have the option <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":999,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/998"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=998"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/998\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/999"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=998"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=998"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=998"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
