We have limited media time, a total of half an hour during the week and a little more on the weekends.<br \/>\nMinecraft is a very creative game, like Lego, only on tablet\/pc\/console.<\/p>\n<p>My son and his friends play together in a world on wifi and build a settlement there together with the coolest buildings and structures. I&#8217;m really impressed how creative they are there. My son has z. B. a house in the shape of a giant duck (no idea how he came up with that ) built, three-dimensionally completely anatomically correct and hollow inside with rooms. On the duck&#8217;s legs, a ladder leads inside, and from the eyes you can go to the crook, which is a balcony.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, the game is designed to make you want to keep going because there&#8217;s always something to build. Actually, most computer games are such that you always want to complete another round or another level. That&#8217;s why I think you have to learn and practice how to deal with it.<\/p>\n<p>By the way, with my son and his best friend, Minecraft also leads to a lot of creativity in real life. They would like to create a Youtube channel with Minecraft Lets Plays and have been planning this for months. They design logos and they write scripts and whenever they meet I see them scribbling and doing and doing&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Of course they are too young to really do that, even legally. But they really have a lot of fun just planning it. If there is ever a video (I&#8217;ve already been asked for help using video editing software), it will be duly appreciated in the family circle, but will not be published. <img class=\"emo\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655518628_182_minecraft-yes-or-no-Forum-Kids-School.gif\" alt=\";-)\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>whoo, my son (9) and his friends play it too.
