On the one hand, there is a version exclusively for Windows 10 (also called Bedrock Edition).  This is only available in the Microsoft Store.  In addition, there is the well-known Java version.<\/p>\n<p>We will show you the advantages and disadvantages of each version in this article!<\/p>\n<h2>Costs<\/h2>\n<p>The Minecraft Java Edition currently costs \u20ac23.95 on the official Minecraft website.  The Starter Edition currently costs \u20ac29.99 in the Windows 10 Store.  This is a bit more expensive than the Java Edition<br \/>At least these are the normal prices.  However, the Windows 10 version is currently available in the most common key shops for around \u20ac4.  The Java version is still significantly more expensive at around \u20ac20.  However, everyone has to decide for themselves whether they want to take the risk associated with the key stores.<\/p>\n<p>Purchasers of the Java edition before October 29, 2018 will receive the <strong>Bedrock version for Windows 10<\/strong> Indeed <strong>for free<\/strong>!  Simply log in to the Minecraft website with your Mojang account and link your Microsoft account.<\/p>\n<p>Minecraft Java Launcher.<\/p>\n<h2>Mods &#038; Texture Packs<\/h2>\n<p>Basically, both versions support texture packs.  However, the Java version has a clear advantage here.  It has been around much longer and is therefore better supported by mod developers.  However, the very popular shaders, which greatly enhance the game&#8217;s visuals, are only available in the Java version.<\/p>\n<p>While there is a marketplace in the Windows 10 version where you can purchase paid skins, texture packs and worlds, this does not exist on Java.  Here 99% of all texture packs can be downloaded for free from the Internet.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654634210_590_Minecraft-Windows-10-or-Java-Edition.png\" alt=\"Minecraft Windows 10 Edition Marketplace\" class=\"wp-image-3013\" width=\"709\" height=\"554\"  \/>The Marketplace from the Windows 10 Edition.  100 of these coins cost about \u20ac0.50 depending on the.<\/p>\n<h2>cross play<\/h2>\n<p>Here the Windows 10 version has a huge advantage.  While the Java players keep to themselves, the Bedrock Edition players on Windows 10 can play with almost any other platform like the Playstation 4, the Xbox One or even the Pocket Edition on Android or iOS.  However, you must either be on the same network or purchase a paid server.<\/p>\n<h2>updates<\/h2>\n<p>This point is the same for both versions.  All updates always appear simultaneously for all versions.  It makes no difference whether you play on mobile, PS4, Java or Windows 10.  Technically, the versions differ only in very few subtleties, which make no difference when actually playing.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654634210_100_Minecraft-Windows-10-or-Java-Edition.png\" alt=\"Minecraft on Windows 10\" class=\"wp-image-3062\" width=\"768\" height=\"431\"  \/>Minecraft in Windows 10 edition<\/p>\n<h2>Performance &#038; Stability<\/h2>\n<p>This always depends on the respective computer.  The Java version in particular often runs very poorly on weaker PCs and laptops.  While powerful gaming PCs and gaming laptops often manage several hundred frames per second, an office laptop often does not even reach 30FPS.<\/p>\n<p>The official minimum requirements for the variant from the Microsoft Store are an Intel Celeron J4105 in conjunction with the Intel HD Graphics 4000 and 4 GB of RAM.<\/p>\n<p>The system requirements for the Java edition are similar.  Nevertheless, we advise you against the Java Edition on very weak computers, unless you want to play on a server together with your \u201cJava friends\u201d, of course.<\/p>\n<h2>More advantages and disadvantages and conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>It should also be mentioned that the Bedrock Edition is the only version that has official controller support.  Anyone who prefers to play Minecraft (for whatever reason) with a controller is better off with the Bedrock version.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, one can say that one cannot say exactly which of the two editions is better or worse.  Everyone, after the above points, must decide for themselves which version is better for them <br \/>suitable is.<\/p>\n<p>On our Technology Capital page you will find many more exciting and helpful articles on various topics such as gaming or Windows!
