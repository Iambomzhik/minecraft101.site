Find out everything you need to know about the video game and whether the game is suitable for children now!<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;\">\ud83c\udfae What parents need to know about the Minecraft video game!<\/h2>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;\"><\/h2>\n<p>Everywhere you see children playing with their smartphones. What they do? Play Minecraft! Because the game is the most successful video game of all time. But most parents don&#8217;t know exactly what their children are doing. I&#8217;ve tested the game myself and I&#8217;ll tell you how it works! \ud83d\udc4d<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px;\">What is Minecraft about? \ud83e\udd14<\/h3>\n<p>Minecraft is all about constructing buildings out of cube-shaped blocks, crafting tools and weapons, and exploring caves. The tools are used to extract raw materials (&#8220;mine&#8221;), which are then processed into other objects (&#8220;craft&#8221;). For example weapons. Because as soon as the sun goes down, various monsters appear (for example the green creepers) against which you have to defend yourself. \u26cf\ufe0f \ud83d\udde1\ufe0f<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Where can you play Minecraft? \ud83e\udd14<\/h3>\n<p>Minecraft was originally designed to be played on PCs and laptops. Meanwhile, there are already editions for mobile devices and game consoles. However, they can be expanded and changed less flexibly. \ud83d\udcbb \ud83d\udcf1<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px;\">How much does Minecraft cost? \ud83e\udd14<\/h3>\n<p>You can download the edition of your choice from the official Minecraft website. There you can either test the time-limited demo version for free or buy the game right away. The Minecraft app costs \u20ac7.49 for Android and the Starter Collection for Windows costs \u20ac29.99. So the costs depend on which edition and on which device you want to play. \ud83d\udcb0<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px;\">At what age can children play Minecraft? \ud83e\udd14<\/h3>\n<p>Minecraft is approved for ages 6 and up. However, it depends very much on which mode you are playing. Because there are 5 game modes in Minecraft: The creative mode, which is best suited for building structures, the adventure mode and the spectator mode are basically harmless. In contrast, Survival and Hardcore modes are much more about combat and confrontation. \u2694\ufe0f<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;\"><\/h2>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;\">\ud83c\udfae Is Minecraft suitable for children?<\/h2>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;\"><\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried Minecraft myself and think: Yes! The creative and adventure mode can be expected of children from the age of 6 years. It&#8217;s actually interactive Lego play. The player can build and set up his own house. If you already have more tools, the house can become a castle. And from the castle later a palace. Exploring the tunnels is exciting &#8211; you never know what&#8217;s around the next corner. And it&#8217;s fun to find new materials and design construction projects as you wish. \ud83c\udfe0 \u27a1\ufe0f \ud83c\udff0<\/p>\n<p>The only thing parents should pay attention to is the usage time. When digging tunnels and looking for valuable materials, it&#8217;s easy to lose track of time. The Minecraft game world is so diverse and the building possibilities are almost endless. Time flies by without you noticing. Fixed media time will help your child maintain sensible Minecraft consumption. Read more about limiting media time and healthy video gaming in general in my article about the game Fortnite! \u231b<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;\"><\/h2>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;\">\ud83c\udfae Why we like Minecraft better than Fortnite!<\/h2>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;\"><\/h2>\n<p>In contrast to shooter games like Fortnite, violence plays little or no role in Minecraft (depending on the game mode). On the contrary: With Minecraft, children can even learn something and use their creativity! \u2b07\ufe0f<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 Because in order to realize large construction projects, it requires planning and a clear objective. Minecraft teaches kids organization and structured thinking!<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 Minecraft does not specify much: There are hardly any instructions and explanations. Players must try, experiment, set goals and explore on their own. That encourages creativity!<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 Minecraft also encourages players to seek solutions and not give up (even if you fall off a cliff in the virtual world). In this way, children can develop solution strategies and learn to deal with mistakes constructively. Our conclusion: as long as the time in front of the screen doesn&#8217;t get out of hand, there&#8217;s nothing to prevent your child from playing Minecraft. Because the game actually offers learning opportunities! And let&#8217;s be honest: There are worse pastimes. So let your child play with it within a regular playing time if it makes them happy! \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Chapter 1.
