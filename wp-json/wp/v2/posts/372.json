Does this apply if you already have the Windows 10 edition or are purchasing an upgrade?  How do you know if you are eligible for Minecraft Java Free Edition?  Is it true at all?<\/p>\n<p class=\"askit-article-answer\">Accepted answer<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft acquired Minecraft developer Mojang in 2014 and released the beta version of the game for Windows 10 in the same year.  While the Java edition of the game remains, the future seems to lie in the Bedrock edition, which will allow for cross-platform play.<\/p>\n<p>The short answer to the question &#8220;Can you get Minecraft Java for free if you bought the Windows 10 edition?&#8221; is yes.  It is possible to get the free version if you already own the Minecraft game.  However, this is not possible for everyone.  And it&#8217;s not as simple as installing a browser extension or updating Windows.  Minecraft: Java Edition owners with a purchase date before October 19, 2018 can get the game for Windows for free.<\/p>\n<p>The question of whether Minecraft Java is free after purchasing the Windows 10 edition has been rumbling on various Internet forums for a while.  It is possible to redeem the free copy of Minecraft with Bedrock Edition on Windows 10.  Players who purchased the game before the October changes can access the game for free through their Mojang account.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>However, if the game was purchased after this point, this feature will not be available.  If you&#8217;re not sure when you bought the game, you can check if you have the corresponding button for the free version.  Pressing this creates a token and takes you to a Microsoft redemption page.<\/p>\n<p>If your account is an older Minecraft account, you may need help moving the account to a Microsoft account.  This is necessary to get the code for Minecraft for Windows 10.  You must be logged into your account to do this.  The license cannot subsequently be transferred once it is attributed to the Mojang account.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"qm-h2-1\">Redeem Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Windows 10<\/h2>\n<p>                Optimize now!
