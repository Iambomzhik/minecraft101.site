It has now been announced that the original version of the block cult game is now available in the browser free of charge.  This currently only works on desktop systems.<\/p>\n<h2>A real nostalgia trip to start the Minecraft era<\/h2>\n<p>The story of Minecraft on desktop computers began on May 17, 2009. In the meantime, the open-world title has risen to the top league of best-selling games with sales of over 155 million units.  The title certainly owes this success to the countless ports that make the game playable not only on desktop systems but also on mobile devices and consoles as well as devices such as Apple TVs.  With the takeover by Microsoft, the range was also expanded to include a version adapted for Windows 10.  For those who want to experience how the game got started, the original version is now available as a free browser version.<br \/>\nReally rudimentary: Minecraft in the browser is back On the new Minecraft Classic website, users can experience the block game as it was made available in 2009 in its first public version.  In other words, connoisseurs of the game will miss a great many of the features that were added in later years.  But if you feel like taking a short excursion into the title&#8217;s past, you can have a thoroughly playable experience here with little effort after our first short test in the browser.  Of course, the browser version doesn&#8217;t stand up to a comparison with current versions &#8211; also in terms of performance.  On mobile devices, the website currently only provides an error message.  <\/p>\n<p>\nAnd that&#8217;s how the developers see it: &#8220;With only 32 blocks to build, all the original bugs, and an interface only a mother could love, Minecraft 2009 is even more glorious than we remembered,&#8221; says the official blog post to read about Minecraft Classic.  But it is precisely this rudimentary structure that makes it possible to make the game available in the browser.  With the sentence &#8220;Play the original and wonder how it ever became so popular&#8221;, the developers make it very clear that they really don&#8217;t have any serious ambitions with this version.<\/p>\n<p>\t<img onclick=\"wfv4_enlarge_teaser_picture('Microsoft','https:\/\/www.minecraft.net\/de-de\/article\/embrace-past-minecraft-classic');\" class=\"photo\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655222240_993_Free-nostalgia-trip-Ur-Minecraft-now-available-in-the-browser.jpg\" alt=\"Browser, Interface, Minecraft, Blocks, Minecraft Classic\" width=\"128\" height=\"72\" \/><br \/>\n\tBrowser Interface Minecraft Blocks Minecraft Classic Microsoft <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Free-nostalgia-trip-Ur-Minecraft-now-available-in-the-browser.gif\" width=\"https:\/\/winfuture.de\/1\" height=\"https:\/\/winfuture.de\/1\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This month Minecraft celebrates its tenth birthday and Microsoft seems to want to provide fans with some innovations around the <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":919,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/915"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=915"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/915\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/919"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=915"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=915"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=915"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
