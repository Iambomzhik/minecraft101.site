They mentioned that it&#8217;s a video game and that they would like to play it.  You have most likely seen many YouTube videos on this subject and you probably know all about it, but you are still confused.  What is Minecraft and should you let your child play with it?  In this article, we will discuss the reason Minecraft is very beneficial for kids, teens and even adults!<\/p>\n<p><center>&#13;<br \/>\n&#13;<br \/>\n&#13;<br \/>\n&#13;<br \/>\n&#13;<br \/>\n<\/center> <\/p>\n<h2 id=\"DOL7DPNG43\">  creativity<\/h2>\n<p align=\"middle\"><\/p>\n<p>Giving a child the opportunity to play Minecraft is like giving them a book and crayons.  However, a better analogy would be to give them Legos.  Minecraft allows children to express themselves in a completely self-manipulable world through the concept of block placement and removal.  With hundreds of blocks available, their imaginations can probably wander to great locations.<\/p>\n<p>  Minecraft&#8217;s popularity has inspired many new creations of players and provided many opportunities for new creative outlets in the game.  Many gamers who may never have been interested in finding an artistic outlet have inadvertently found a place to let their artistic visions roam free.  With Minecraft being a three dimensional game rather than a two dimensional game, players have found that they enjoy creating large houses, statues, structures and many other things they can imagine.<\/p>\n<p>Finding an outlet to create and express yourself is of great benefit for a child, even if expressing yourself is as easy as building a small virtual home in a block world.  When nobody judges your creations, nobody tells you what you&#8217;re doing is wrong, and nobody tells you what you can and can&#8217;t do in your own little world, you can only expect positive results.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"RKH8Z252JL\">  solve problems<\/h2>\n<p>  Minecraft&#8217;s ability to help players solve problems has only increased as more and more features have been added to the game.  When a player wants to create something in their game and can&#8217;t figure out how, Minecraft prompts you to find a way.  If you&#8217;re focused on something you want to accomplish in Minecraft, you can bet you&#8217;ll do whatever it takes to get the job done.  When you have achieved your goal that you have set for yourself, you will most likely feel very happy that you have done what you probably thought impossible at first.  This feeling doesn&#8217;t usually wear off right away and will likely come back every time you see your build.  After seeing your previous builds, you can get inspiration to create something new and even more complex than before.  When you start a new build, you&#8217;ll likely follow the same steps to resolve issues that occurred when you first built the creation.<\/p>\n<p>When you give players the ability to find their own answers to problems, you provide a backbone for future problems they may encounter (inside or outside of the video game).  When you are building a new building it is important to have this certainty.  Relying on solving problems is very beneficial, especially when dealing with real-world scenarios.  After playing Minecraft, you may find that your child looks at the problems more logically.  When a player has an idea for something in Minecraft, the idea is usually premeditated and planned.  Think before you put anything in Minecraft allows players to understand what they want to do in a more orderly way.  This idea of \u200b\u200bthinking Minecraft can very easily be translated to solving problems in the real world.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"I7Y7F9E5AK\">  fun<\/h2>\n<p>Finding something to enjoy can be extremely irritating as a child, teenager, or even as an adult.  For many people, video games offer an instant form of fun and can be a great way to pass time.  Unlike most video games, Minecraft tends to be different.  Usually, video games tend to have an end goal or something along those lines.  While Minecraft does have an &#8220;ending,&#8221; it&#8217;s entirely optional.  Minecraft does not have a predetermined goal that is set by the video game itself.  All goals in Minecraft are set by the player alone.  In Minecraft there is no source that tells you what you can and cannot do.<\/p>\n<p>The fact that no entity specifically informs you about how to enjoy the game gives players the freedom to experience Minecraft their own way. Giving players the opportunity to lose themselves in their own little world is a pleasure Assert creativity and demonstrate their skills through their various creations.  The power of Minecraft holds for a person to be able to enjoy themselves while doing what they perceive to be extreme.  Telling a person what to do makes a video game feel more like a chore than an experience.  While many enjoy finding a path in video games that I can follow in my many years playing Minecraft I have yet to hear a single complaint of a player not being guided.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"N51W23NPZK\">  Relieves stress<\/h2>\n<p>A while ago, in a previous article, we discussed why Minecraft was such a relaxing video game to experience.From being able to escape from daily life, to having an endless sandbox, to creating an adventure on the inside, to being able to create anything , what you want and many more reasons.  Minecraft somehow brings us peace.  Minecraft&#8217;s ability to relieve a person&#8217;s stress through the various elements of gameplay is incredible.<\/p>\n<p>  Minecraft was essentially built the way you want the video game to be.  If you want to experience a video game regardless of your ideal gameplay concept, this will always be an inspiration.  This freedom allows players to feel comfortable and know if they want a more intense type of experience or a slowed down and peaceful experience.  The option to change them is just a few clicks away.  Minecraft&#8217;s extensive customization options are a key asset in creating a desired gaming experience.  Finding your perfect way to experience Minecraft is an essential part of stress relief.  If the game does not meet your expectations, it is likely that a change will be made that will allow for an extended gaming session.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"YZCXH6DHW3\">  Used in schools<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not yet convinced that allowing your child to play Minecraft might increase your interest.  In 2011, MinecraftEDU was released to the public.  The very popular mod was immediately noticed by schools around the world.  Teachers noted that Minecraft&#8217;s ability to impact a child&#8217;s learning was much greater than expected.  In many classrooms, learning with pencil and paper is a thing of the past.  The instructors in the schools started taking the students on tours of famous cities in our real world, in Minecraft.  The teachers also taught other basic studies.<\/p>\n<p>As MinecraftEDU&#8217;s popularity grew, Mojang and Microsoft caught wind of the excitement.  Buying up MinecraftEDU As quickly as they could, both Microsoft and Mojang announced Minecraft: Education Edition.  This would become the first officially licensed Minecraft spin-off classroom video game.<\/p>\n<p>Mojang COO Vu Bui explained, \u201cOne of the reasons Minecraft fits so well into the classroom is that it&#8217;s a collaborative, creative playground.  We&#8217;ve seen that Minecraft transcends the differences in teaching and learning styles and education systems around the world.  It&#8217;s an open space where people can come together and build lessons around almost anything.  &#8220;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"DT0KFMFQCS\">  Finally<\/h2>\n<p>While many parents have conflicting views on whether or not video games should be allowed in a household, consider Minecraft a toy.  Minecraft is essentially a toy for children, teens and adults of all genders.  The ability to learn something new, the ability to manipulate your own world, bring your ideas to life in the form of virtual blocks, and much more should inspire you to give your child a new creative opportunity.  If anything, the ability to do all these different things should inspire you to give your loved one (or yourself) a try.<\/p>\n<p>Getting stronger and stronger every day Minecraft has a very positive community to let your child experience.  Minecraft community includes many different ideas.  People of all ages love to experience Minecraft whether the community they are in is based on servers your child can play online with other people, videos on YouTube and much more.  Minecraft popularity is only growing within schools, allowing for friendships to be formed with other students.<\/p>\n<p>Consider giving your child a chance to try and experience Minecraft as they might find a passion they had no idea how they had it.  Many have found artistic skills and abilities that they may never have attempted to use in Minecraft.  Being constantly surrounded by manipulable environments makes players feel like they have full control over what happens in their virtual sandbox.  Breaking blocks, fighting mobs, creating structures and machines without being noticed, learning various learning elements and much more are available in Minecraft. <\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to help your child take steps toward another adventure, find their artistic passion, or find a way to relieve their stress.  Minecraft impacting your child could be the next step in inspiring them to improve in ways they might never have imagined.  If you&#8217;re at all concerned or on the fence about letting your loved ones indulge in this video game, understand that millions of people have played and loved Minecraft since it was first released.  Be open minded and maybe even give the video game a shot.  You have no idea what small (or big) impact it can have on you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So you&#8217;re a parent and your kid recently started talking about one thing, Minecraft.
