Computer games also have a positive effect on our cognitive abilities. <\/p>\n<p>Gambling trains the ability to concentrate and trains the working memory.  Gamers often learn faster and better.  The game &#8220;Super Mario&#8221; even promotes the growth of certain brain regions.  The neuroscientists Joana St\u00e4b and Uwe Ilg from the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research at the University of T\u00fcbingen have now discovered another positive effect:<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"o-headline\">Video games train our so-called number sense, so that we can estimate quantities better.<\/h3>\n<p>The following applies: the more, the better.  The effect is probably due to the brain&#8217;s increased attention, as the researchers write in a press release.  The ability to correctly estimate the number of objects at a glance is innate in us humans.  For example, we don&#8217;t have to count every single apple to find out that there are three in the shopping cart.<\/p><source data-breakpoint=\"Large\" data-src-template=\"https:\/\/img.welt.de\/img\/kmpkt\/mobile231868043\/1200247607-ci3x2l-wWIDTH\/Three-apples-in-a-row-red-green-yellow-close-up.jpg\" data- media=\"(min-width: 910px)\"><source data-breakpoint=\"Medium\" data-src-template=\"https:\/\/img.welt.de\/img\/kmpkt\/mobile231868043\/1200247607-ci3x2l-wWIDTH\/Three-apples-in-a-row-red-green-yellow-close-up.jpg\" data- media=\"(min-width: 600px)\"><source data-breakpoint=\"Small\" data-src-template=\"https:\/\/img.welt.de\/img\/kmpkt\/mobile231868043\/1200247607-ci3x2l-wWIDTH\/Three-apples-in-a-row-red-green-yellow-close-up.jpg\" data-><img style=\"background-image: url('https:\/\/www.welt.de\/assets\/images\/global\/welt_fallback-f924e6874c.gif');\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655625856_901_Gaming-Gambling-has-this-advantage-for-your-brain.jpg\" data-component=\"LazyLoad\" class=\"o-overlay c-placeholder__image\" data-qa=\"PictureElement.OriginalImage\" alt=\"Gaming: Computer games have this advantage on your brain\"\/><\/source><\/source><\/source>    <\/p>\n<p>  Source: Getty Images\/PhotoAlto\/Isabelle Rozenbaum <\/p>\n<p>The same applies to the number sense as to our other senses: the smaller the difference between two stimuli, such as the size of a quantity or the pitch of a tone, the more difficult it is for us to perceive it.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"o-element__body\">\n<p>  However, we can train our perception.  Musicians, for example, perceive very subtle differences in loudness.  We were interested in whether the number sense can also be trained. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>For their study, which was published in the journal Addiction Biology, the researchers tested a total of 66 subjects.  Half gambled more than four hours a week on the computer, the other half not even one.  In the experiments, the study participants looked at two circles on a screen that contained black dots.  Subjects were asked to spontaneously indicate which had more.<\/p>\n<p>  Animal gamers <\/p><source data-breakpoint=\"Medium\" data-src-template=\"https:\/\/img.welt.de\/img\/bildergalerien\/mobile226429495\/3182507827-ci102l-wWIDTH\/Synchronised-piglets-in-a-row.jpg\" data- media=\"(min-width: 600px)\"><source data-breakpoint=\"Small\" data-src-template=\"https:\/\/img.welt.de\/img\/bildergalerien\/mobile226429495\/3182507827-ci102l-wWIDTH\/Synchronised-piglets-in-a-row.jpg\" data-><img style=\"background-image: url('https:\/\/www.welt.de\/assets\/images\/global\/welt_fallback-f924e6874c.gif');\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655625856_157_Gaming-Gambling-has-this-advantage-for-your-brain.jpg\" data-component=\"LazyLoad\" class=\"o-overlay c-placeholder__image\" data-qa=\"PictureElement.OriginalImage\" alt=\"Pigs can play video games\"\/><\/source><\/source>      <\/p>\n<p>The result: the computer players made just as many mistakes as the non-players.
