Admittedly, I&#8217;m a little late, because Minecraft has been around since 2011. Now some readers have asked for an article about Minecraft from a parent&#8217;s perspective.  I started Minecraft back in 2011.  Today both my 7 year old and my 11 year old son play Minecraft regularly.  So who better to write about it?  My son created the following text, which I just commented on with &#8220;Parents&#8217; perspective&#8221;.  Leave him a comment!<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"warum-minecraft-das-perfekte-spiel-fur-kinder-ist\">Why Minecraft is the perfect game for kids<\/h2>\n<p><strong>What is Minecraft?<\/strong> Minecraft is a <strong>Open world game<\/strong> in which there is no prescribed goal.  You can explore the world of Minecraft and plunge into exciting adventures.  There is a lot to explore, such as different dungeons or normal caves where you can find ores and other valuable resources for later gameplay (gaming experience) and mine them with a pickaxe.  There are also different dungeons like the Nether (like hell) or the end.<\/p>\n<p><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" alt=\"Minecraft explained to parents - from the child!  - mamaskind.de\" class=\"wp-image-24027\"  data-lazy- data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https:\/\/mamaskind.de\/tipps-und-tests\/minecraft-erklaert\/\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"Minecraft f\u00fcr Eltern erkl\u00e4rt\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Minecraft-explained-for-parents-Let-your-child-play.jpeg\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Minecraft-explained-for-parents-Let-your-child-play.jpeg\"\/>Minecraft explained to parents &#8211; from the child!<\/p>\n<p>You decide for yourself which way you want to go.  Do you want to build the most beautiful castle?  Do you want to explore caves or meet the villagers?  Are you interested in making the coolest things with the found materials?  Minecraft gives you the choice!  Both children and adults can let off steam creatively in Minecraft.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"minecraft-erklart-so-wird-gespielt\">Minecraft explained: How to play<\/h2>\n<p><strong>About the gameplay:<\/strong> You start in a world with different biomes (ice and snow biomes, grass and meadow biomes, mountains, forests, jungles, swamps and many more).<\/p>\n<p>You can craft different tools for different activities that will make playing easier for you.  Minecraft is a very realistic game except for the fact that all textures are square.  There is no blood when you kill animals or monsters to get raw materials for various recipes.  The opponent then only lights up red once and disappears in a kind of fog when he has been fought.<\/p>\n<p><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" alt=\"The boys play Minecraft together on the Switch.  |  More information at Mamaskind.de\" class=\"wp-image-14719\"  data-lazy- data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https:\/\/mamaskind.de\/tipps-und-tests\/minecraft-erklaert\/\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"Minecraft f\u00fcr Eltern erkl\u00e4rt\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Minecraft-explained-for-parents-Let-your-child-play.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Minecraft-explained-for-parents-Let-your-child-play.jpg\"\/>The boys play Minecraft together on the Switch.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"verschiedene-spielmodi-in-minecraft\">Different game modes in Minecraft<\/h3>\n<p>There are different game modes like survival mode, adventure and creative mode.  In which <strong>survival mode<\/strong> you fight for survival by killing monsters and crafting important tools.  But watch out, the monsters come at night, build your dwelling before nightfall!<\/p>\n<p>in the <strong>creative mode<\/strong> you can let your creativity run free and express your thoughts with buildings.  In Minecraft Creative Mode, no one tells you what to do and what not to do, you decide. <\/p>\n<p>But there is another game mode, namely the <strong>adventure mode<\/strong>.  In this mode you can look at buildings but not destroy them. <\/p>\n<p><img width=\"700\" height=\"525\" alt=\"First computer game: Minecraft - Minecraft explained to parents\" class=\"wp-image-3627\"  data-lazy- data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https:\/\/mamaskind.de\/tipps-und-tests\/minecraft-erklaert\/\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"Minecraft f\u00fcr Eltern erkl\u00e4rt\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654181496_189_Minecraft-explained-for-parents-Let-your-child-play.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654181496_189_Minecraft-explained-for-parents-Let-your-child-play.jpg\"\/>First computer game: Minecraft &#8211; explained for parents<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"schwierigkeitsgrad-lebst-du-lieber-gefahrlich\">Difficulty level: Prefer to live dangerously?<\/h3>\n<p>There are four different difficulty levels: peaceful, easy, normal and hard.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Peaceful<\/strong>: No monsters are generated, you don&#8217;t lose hunger clubs, and you continuously regenerate life.  Perfect for younger kids!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Easy<\/strong>: Monsters are generated, Creepers (green exploding monsters) stop their explosion even if you move a few blocks away, enemies deal much less damage. <\/li>\n<li><strong>normal<\/strong>: Monsters are generated, you lose Hunger Clubs, and you can only regenerate life by eating something.  You can only eat when you are hungry. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Difficult<\/strong>: Monsters are generated, enemies deal significantly more damage than in the other difficulties, and they drop fewer items.  Also, zombies can break down doors and there is a chance if you use a throwing potion that a spider will spawn.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"altersempfehlung-fur-minecraft\">Age recommendation for Minecraft<\/h2>\n<p><strong>From what age is Minecraft suitable?<\/strong> Minecraft is approved by the entertainment software self-control (USK) from six years.  It also depends on which mode you play.  While Creative and Adventure modes are relatively harmless, Survival and Hardcore modes are more offensive and attack-oriented. <\/p>\n<p><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" alt=\"The little son can watch his brother play Minecraft - Minecraft explained to parents\" class=\"wp-image-14662\"  data-lazy- data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https:\/\/mamaskind.de\/tipps-und-tests\/minecraft-erklaert\/\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"Minecraft f\u00fcr Eltern erkl\u00e4rt\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654181496_493_Minecraft-explained-for-parents-Let-your-child-play.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654181496_493_Minecraft-explained-for-parents-Let-your-child-play.jpg\"\/>The little son can watch his brother play Minecraft<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"haufig-gestellte-fragen-zu-minecraft-von-eltern\">Frequently asked questions about Minecraft from parents<\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>parent view<\/strong>: Honestly, as a mom, I grew into Minecraft.  I played the game with my husband when it was still a newcomer to the gaming market.  So I never questioned whether it was educationally valuable.<\/p>\n<p>You can imagine Minecraft like Lego in the digital world.  You can either just build or engage in battles with your character.  This is what makes Minecraft magic.  At the beginning we set our then 6-year-old son that he could only play Minecraft peacefully.  Then there are no scary moments in the game.  Our son has now been playing Minecraft for over 6 years and obviously knows a lot more than we parents do!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Is Minecraft Educational?<\/h3>\n<p>As weird as it sounds, Minecraft can actually be educational for kids.  You can exercise creativity and use the so-called &#8220;Redstone&#8221; to build real, complex, mechanical works of art, such as a working computer.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">How much does Minecraft cost?<\/h3>\n<p>Minecraft Cost: The Minecraft Java Edition costs \u20ac23.95.  The price of the Bedrock Edition is between 20-30 \u20ac on the different platforms.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Is there an in game store?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, there is an in-game store.  Here you can buy cosmetic items such as wings, headdresses, pets or even worlds in which you can play.  The currency is called &#8220;Minecoins&#8221;, which you can buy from there, on the Internet, in the game launcher (program interface), or in the Nintendo or Playstation Store.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">What platforms is Minecraft available on?<\/h3>\n<p>Minecraft, as it is one of the most well-known, if not the most well-known, of all games, exists on almost every platform.  Minecraft is available for smartphones, Nintendo Switch, PC, Playstation and Xbox.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Which versions are there?<\/h3>\n<p>There are different versions of Minecraft that you can choose from.  I personally play the 1.18.1 version as it can use many different items to build and survive.  There are still updates for Minecraft!<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Minecraft online game: Can you chat?<\/h3>\n<p>There is an in-game chat for communication.  Games can meet for this on numerous online servers.  The chat can too <strong>hidden<\/strong> will.  Then, however, no more messages from the server are displayed.  It is better to allow commands &#8220;<strong>Show commands only<\/strong>&#8220;.  Because it makes Minecraft really powerful!  More info: Chat in Minecraft.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"darum-ist-minecraft-toll-fur-kinder\">That&#8217;s why Minecraft is great for kids<\/h2>\n<p>That&#8217;s another positive point about Minecraft, the variety that you can experience in the game.  There are different locations, biomes, dungeons, textures, all kinds of creatures, not to mention the items.  You can combine many items to create unique results.  Of course there are many other good versions, actually all Minecraft versions are good versions, each one is special in its own way ;).<\/p>\n<p><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" alt=\"Build Minecraft - is like Lego in a computer game!  - mamaskind.de\" class=\"wp-image-24026\"  data-lazy- data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https:\/\/mamaskind.de\/tipps-und-tests\/minecraft-erklaert\/\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"Minecraft f\u00fcr Eltern erkl\u00e4rt\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654181497_416_Minecraft-explained-for-parents-Let-your-child-play.jpeg\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654181497_416_Minecraft-explained-for-parents-Let-your-child-play.jpeg\"\/>Build Minecraft &#8211; is like Lego in a computer game!<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"minecraft-server-finden-fur-altere-kinder\">Finding Minecraft servers &#8211; for older kids<\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>parent view<\/strong>: My son wasn&#8217;t allowed to play on a server when he was very young.  Since he has known YouTubers, he has of course also looked at featured Minecraft servers here.  These can have different game modes.  In Bedwars e.g.  B. dismantled a bed and then wiped out the opponent.  It&#8217;s far too exciting for very young children, even if no blood is spilled.  Of course, it always depends on the child himself.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"wie-finde-ich-einen-geeigneten-minecraft-server\">How do I find a suitable Minecraft server?<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Minecraft servers and how to find them<\/strong>: You can play Minecraft on servers together with other players.  There are thousands of servers in Minecraft, but which are the safest and largest? <\/p>\n<p><strong>My 3 top Minecraft servers<\/strong> are an English server of the &#8220;<strong>hypixel<\/strong>&#8220;Servers of&#8221;<strong>GommeHD<\/strong>\u201c Server a good server created by a German YouTubers, and the \u201c<strong>PurpleOre<\/strong>\u201c Server, also an English server.  All servers have an in-game server that is 100% secure.  You can play all sorts of things on the Hypixel server, such as Sky Wars or Bed Wars. <\/p>\n<p><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" alt=\"Explore the Minecraft world - the perfect game for children of primary school age - mamaskind.de\" class=\"wp-image-24030\"  data-lazy- data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https:\/\/mamaskind.de\/tipps-und-tests\/minecraft-erklaert\/\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"Minecraft f\u00fcr Eltern erkl\u00e4rt\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654181498_453_Minecraft-explained-for-parents-Let-your-child-play.jpeg\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654181498_453_Minecraft-explained-for-parents-Let-your-child-play.jpeg\"\/>Explore the Minecraft world &#8211; the perfect game for elementary school children<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"minecraft-server-mit-kreativmodus\">Minecraft server with creative mode<\/h3>\n<p>Or simply let your imagination run wild in creative mode.

I can only recommend trying Minecraft for yourself and then playing in a world together with your child.  You can also create a server locally \u2013 on your computer.  So there is no contact with the outside world and you are well informed about what your child loves about Minecraft.<\/p>\n<p>And if you&#8217;re not a gambler yourself, that&#8217;s no problem either.  Just watch a Let&#8217;s Play video together.  These are gameplay footage from Minecraft players that puts you right in the middle of the action.<\/p>\n<p>The player and YouTuber is definitely known throughout Germany <strong>gronk<\/strong>.
