But did you know that it can also be a great learning tool?  From academic to social skills, Minecraft can help kids reach their full potential. <\/p>\n<p>Read on to find out how Minecraft can be educational for your child and how FunTech is using it to create engaging learning experiences. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<h3>What is Minecraft?<\/h3>\n<p>Minecraft is a kid-friendly computer game that combines exploration and survival skills.  It tests children&#8217;s imagination and creativity. <\/p>\n<p>Simply put, it&#8217;s like digital LEGO &#8211; your child can create anything from a small cottage to a vast, sprawling metropolis.  When you then add monsters and other challenging characters, it gets really interesting.  The player must quickly learn how to survive and adapt in the Minecraft world! <\/p>\n<h3>Is Minecraft educational?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, we believe so!  But not only us, research also suggests this.  We&#8217;ll get into that later in this guide. <\/p>\n<p>Some schools in the UK have started using it in the classroom.  According to this 2016 BBC News report, Minecraft is already being used in some form in more than 7,000 classrooms around the world. <\/p>\n<p>Here are our top 11 reasons why we think Minecraft is educational, and why you don&#8217;t have to worry if your child loves this game. <\/p>\n<p> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654411092_163_11-Reasons-Minecraft-is-Educational-for-Kids-FunTech-Blog.jpg\" alt=\"Minecraft\" width=\"1024\" height=\"505\"   class=\"aligncenter\"\/><\/p>\n<h3>Is Minecraft safe for children?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, if used correctly and responsibly.  Minecraft is perfectly safe for children provided the correct parental controls have been set. <\/p>\n<p>Children can write their own story, team up with friends and build anything they want in a safe environment. <\/p>\n<p>We encourage you to read this guide from the NSPPC.  It tells parents what settings and modes they should use and which versions of the game they should give their child access to.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654411093_75_11-Reasons-Minecraft-is-Educational-for-Kids-FunTech-Blog.jpg\" alt=\"restone\" width=\"1024\" height=\"505\"   class=\"aligncenter\"\/><\/p>\n<h4>#1: Minecraft helps kids learn problem-solving techniques<\/h4>\n<p>Problem solving ability determines how well a child can deal with obstacles, both in hypothetical and real life.  Minecraft can encourage and expand this way of thinking. <\/p>\n<p>An example of this is the game&#8217;s &#8220;survival mode&#8221;.  In this mode, the player must maintain their hunger and health in the face of dangerous monsters and other obstacles.  They must quickly figure out how to escape, find cover and learn to survive in these short 10 minute scenes. <\/p>\n<p>  This can encourage critical thinking and teach your child to react quickly and efficiently to solve real-world problems. <\/p>\n<h4>#2: Minecraft can promote reading and writing skills<\/h4>\n<p>So why is Minecraft already being used in classrooms? <\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a well-known fact that kids learn best when they&#8217;re having fun, and with Minecraft, that&#8217;s exactly what they do. <\/p>\n<p>If a child is motivated to progress in the Minecraft game, they must have a good understanding of the written instructions that appear on the screen. <\/p>\n<p>If they are also playing with classmates, they must use the chat feature to read messages and text back and forth as part of the team play. <\/p>\n<h4>#3: Minecraft encourages curiosity<\/h4>\n<p>After a Minecraft session, you may find that your child becomes much more curious.  It may even want to explore things on its own. <\/p>\n<p>Part of the game requires children to complete challenges.  In order to advance, they need to find hints and tricks that will help them. <\/p>\n<p>This can be online research, e.g.  B. on Wikipedia or YouTube, or even a visit to the local library!  There are many books about Minecraft tutorials.  Your child will have to analyze them all to find the best information. <\/p>\n<p>  That sounds almost like doing this for a school project or term paper, right? <\/p>\n<p> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654411093_542_11-Reasons-Minecraft-is-Educational-for-Kids-FunTech-Blog.jpg\" alt=\"Minecraft\" width=\"1024\" height=\"505\"   class=\"aligncenter\"\/><\/p>\n<h4>#4: Minecraft helps kids with math problems<\/h4>\n<p>Minecraft is already being used in classrooms to support math learning. <\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s just one example from a teacher in the United States who used Minecraft to empower his students.  This is his comment on the educational benefits of Minecraft: <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat year, I was teaching third grade in downtown Los Angeles and I was determined to teach math with Minecraft.  I was glad I did.  Within six months, my class&#8217;s test scores went from 18 percent to 84 percent in math and from 24 percent to 81 percent in English.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>As children play Minecraft, they develop complex shapes, solve geometric problems, and manipulate blocks.  These are all important math concepts that will be part of your child&#8217;s curriculum. <\/p>\n<h4>#5: Minecraft teaches kids how to use resources<\/h4>\n<p>In Minecraft, children learn to calculate how much things cost and how much time it takes them to complete certain tasks. <\/p>\n<p>  For example, they might need to gather wood to build part of a dwelling.  You could do it by hand, but it&#8217;s faster with an axe&#8230; The only problem is that the axe has to be paid for and eventually becomes blunt.<\/p>\n<p>  Learning how to pay for resources and use them efficiently is a key aspect of a child&#8217;s educational and practical development. <\/p>\n<h4>#6: Minecraft teaches kids the benefits of teamwork<\/h4>\n<p>Minecraft games require cooperation with other children and fellow players.  Sometimes this is even the only way to achieve certain goals. <\/p>\n<p>By pooling and sharing resources while planning together, children learn to rely on each other.  They will need to work together positively to achieve their common goal! <\/p>\n<p> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654411093_821_11-Reasons-Minecraft-is-Educational-for-Kids-FunTech-Blog.jpg\" alt=\"Minecraft modding\" width=\"1024\" height=\"505\"   class=\"aligncenter\"\/><\/p>\n<h4>#7: Minecraft can help build a child&#8217;s confidence<\/h4>\n<p>It&#8217;s entirely possible that Minecraft can help build your child&#8217;s confidence.  Once they learn awesome Minecraft skills, they can share them with friends and make new friends!<\/p>\n<h4>#8: Minecraft can help kids learn about history<\/h4>\n<p>Recreating famous and historical landmarks in Minecraft is a popular educational use of the game. <\/p>\n<p>Children can solve tasks that involve a large amount of historical research.  This includes understanding the key points of human civilization, mapping locations and re-enacting famous events. <\/p>\n<p>Your child needs to understand math and scale as they relate these places to past experiences. <\/p>\n<p>  For example, in 2016 the Museum of London used Minecraft to recreate the Great Fire of 1666.  You can see how it was done on the museum&#8217;s website and in this YouTube video.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654411094_464_11-Reasons-Minecraft-is-Educational-for-Kids-FunTech-Blog.jpg\" alt=\"Minecraft modding\" width=\"1024\" height=\"505\"   class=\"aligncenter\"\/><\/p>\n<h4>#9: Minecraft can stimulate a child&#8217;s creativity and imagination<\/h4>\n<p>Minecraft really has no limits &#8211; there aren&#8217;t any! <\/p>\n<p>If your kid wants to build an amusement park, then they can do that.  Or maybe they want to build a 100ft tall version of their grandma&#8230; anything is possible &#8211; the Minecraft world is limitless. <\/p>\n<p>  The Minecraft platform allows kids to imagine and build anything they want, real or not.  The only limitation is that it must be built with small building blocks. <\/p>\n<p> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654411094_508_11-Reasons-Minecraft-is-Educational-for-Kids-FunTech-Blog.jpg\" alt=\"MinecraftJava\" width=\"1024\" height=\"505\"   class=\"aligncenter\"\/><\/p>\n<h4>#10: Minecraft can help a kid learn to code<\/h4>\n<p>At FunTech, we&#8217;re big advocates of teaching kids to code.  Read our 13 reasons why parents should encourage coding if you haven&#8217;t already!<\/p>\n<p>Minecraft contributes to this potentially important learning ability with its high degree of customization.  Children can edit the original Minecraft code in the form of mods to customize the game in different ways.  It can be as small as changing the weather or as big as creating an invincible flying squid!  It&#8217;s all possible with Minecraft&#8217;s command blocks. <\/p>\n<p>If you want to go even further, your child can modify the program with Java code.  It can also develop other programming skills, such as  B. Debugging.  When they&#8217;re done, they can share these mods with their friends and teammates, creating a unique experience. <\/p>\n<p> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654411095_998_11-Reasons-Minecraft-is-Educational-for-Kids-FunTech-Blog.jpg\" alt=\"Logic Gates\" width=\"1024\" height=\"505\"   class=\"aligncenter\"\/><\/p>\n<h4>#11: Minecraft offers valuable skills for the future<\/h4>\n<p>All of the pedagogical aspects we have talked about will no doubt provide your child with a good foundation for future career prospects.<\/p>\n<p>The elements associated with Minecraft can help teach not only technical skills but also simulate business skills such as trading and relationship building.<\/p>\n<p>  Used correctly, Minecraft can give your child a solid background in the core STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), all of which are critical to the 21st century workplace.<\/p>\n<p>If you also consider the social skills that Minecraft can develop, your child could also become very good at negotiation, project planning, and teamwork.  These are all skills that employers will always be looking for, now and in the future. <\/p>\n<h4>How FunTech can help<\/h4>\n<p>If you have a child who already loves Minecraft or wants to go beyond the basics, then check out the Minecraft camps at FunTech Summer Camps. <\/p>\n<p>We run Minecraft summer camps in various locations across London and the UK including Minecraft with Mods for 7-10 year olds, Minecraft Redstone for 9-12 year olds and Minecraft Bedwars Builder for 11-15 year olds. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a parent, you&#8217;ve undoubtedly heard of Minecraft.
