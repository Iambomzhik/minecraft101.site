Aternos makes it easier than most to toggle some options on your server.  Here are some server settings and changes below:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>To change the server settings, first go to the \u201cOptions\u201d tab and click on it on the left side.

If you want to download the world your server is already in, you can do it on this tab.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>How to connect your server with Minecraft Java or Bedrock Edition<\/h3>\n<p>With the server up and running, now it&#8217;s time to invite your friends over and play Minecraft.
