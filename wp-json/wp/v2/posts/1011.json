Users can do whatever they want in the sandbox, from building their dream house (or world) to collecting all the farm items.<\/p>\n<h2>Minecraft game modes<\/h2>\n<p>Minecraft offers players different game modes.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>survival mode<\/strong> .  The goal of this game mode, as the name suggests, is to survive.  In this mode, players must gather resources to craft all kinds of items.  The character has a health bar that is depleted by falls, drowning, lava falls, suffocation, starvation, and other events.  In addition, there are also monsters that usually appear at night, so we must have weapons to defend ourselves or build a shelter to spend the night.<\/li>\n<li><strong>creative mode<\/strong> .  From the start, this mode offers us all the resources that we can find in the game and also allows us to move freely vertically.  In this mode you can shape the creations you want.<\/li>\n<li><strong>adventure mode<\/strong> .  This mode is similar to Survival mode but with different limitations.  It is designed to allow players to follow a &#8220;story&#8221; of sorts based on other players&#8217; maps.<\/li>\n<li><strong>spectator mode<\/strong> .  In this mode, the user is a simple &#8220;spectator&#8221;.  He can move freely on the map, walk through walls and not interact with the environment at all.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition, how could it be less, Minecraft also has a multiplayer mode, both locally and on LAN and via the Internet with servers.  This game mode allows multiple players to interact with each other and the environment in the same world.<\/p>\n<h2>Minecraft free download for Windows<\/h2>\n<p>Minecraft has always been developed in Java.  This made it possible to make this game available for Windows, macOS and Linux right from the start and also to offer cross-platform online games.<\/p>\n<p>Minecraft is a paid game.  If we want to unlock all the options and functions, we have to buy a license of the game on its website, which costs 24 euros.  It&#8217;s not exactly cheap, although given the overall offering and price of current games, it&#8217;s not among the more expensive.<\/p>\n<p>Today it is possible to download two versions of this game.  The first, the original, based on Java, and a completely renewed version optimized for Windows 10 and the UWP platform.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">Both versions are chargeable.  But if we want to test the game before checking it out (or if we don&#8217;t mind using it with the restrictions), we can <strong>Download the Minecraft Free Trial at<\/strong> go from link below.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>When downloading Minecraft, we download an installer (msi) that we must run on our computer.  This is responsible for downloading the game from Microsoft&#8217;s servers, configuring the Java engine and launching the game.  We must be registered in Mojang to enter the world of Minecraft.<\/p>\n<p><img ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1\" class=\"ezlazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655345923_982_Heres-how-to-download-Minecraft-for-Windows-for-free.jpg\"\/><\/p>\n<h3>Try Minecraft Edition for Windows 10 for free<\/h3>\n<p>If we&#8217;re not using the original Java-based edition and want to try the Windows 10 edition, all we have to do is download the Minecraft UWP free trial from the Microsoft Store.<\/p>\n<p><img ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1\" class=\"ezlazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Heres-how-to-download-Minecraft-for-Windows-for-free.png\"\/><\/p>\n<p><img ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1\" class=\"ezlazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Heres-how-to-download-Minecraft-for-Windows-for-free.jpeg\"\/><\/p>\n<p>Developer: Microsoft Studios<\/p>\n<p>As with any app, once downloaded, we open the trial version, log in with our Microsoft account and can start playing.<\/p>\n<h3>How to buy the full version of Minecraft<\/h3>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">If we want to unlock all the functions and features of Minecraft we have to buy a full license of this game.  To do this, just go to the next link and select the version you want to buy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Minecraft Java Edition<\/strong> : the classic game in its original form at a price of 23.95 euros.  one-time payment.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Minecraft windows 10 edition<\/strong> &#8211; An improved version of the classic game with more features, functionality and content (like expansions).  It costs $29.99, includes the base game, Minecoins, and other additional content, and works on any device running Windows 10.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1\" class=\"ezlazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655345923_68_Heres-how-to-download-Minecraft-for-Windows-for-free.png\"\/><\/p>\n<p><img ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1\" class=\"ezlazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655345924_866_Heres-how-to-download-Minecraft-for-Windows-for-free.jpeg\"\/><\/p>\n<p>Developer: Microsoft Studios<\/p>\n<p>Both versions allow us to get the most out of the experience of this sandbox game.  However, we must choose the edition that best suits our needs, whether we want to pay less or have a more complete experience (albeit with a lot of in-game content to spend the money on).<\/p>\n<h2>Differences of Minecraft in Java and version for Windows 10<\/h2>\n<p>Both versions contain the base game and the gaming experience of both the Java version and the Windows 10 edition is the same.  The game modes are the same and the possibilities are the same.<\/p>\n<p>However, the Windows 10 edition has a number of add-ons to improve the player experience that are not available in the Java edition.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for touch screens.<\/li>\n<li>Minecraft market.<\/li>\n<li>DLC and other downloadable content (two new DLCs will be released this year).<\/li>\n<li>Recommended multiplayer servers.<\/li>\n<li>Administrator of private servers from Microsoft &#8220;plus&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Trophies and Achievements.<\/li>\n<li>Parental controls with an Xbox Live or Microsoft account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Otherwise, Windows 10 and Java versions are the same.  Both are mod compatible, allow you to rent servers from Microsoft, host private servers, and allow gaming over LAN and Wi-Fi.<\/p>\n<h2>install mods<\/h2>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">In addition to the large amount of content available for Minecraft, users create their own content in the form of mods that anyone can download and play for free.  However, since Mojang has never taken a stand against mods, it doesn&#8217;t provide a very easy way to use them either.  Therefore it is necessary to resort to special software, called Minecraft Forge , which allows us to do this.<\/p>\n<p>Once we have the program, we&#8217;ll run it with it already loaded into memory.  The next step is to search the internet for the mod that we want to use.  There are a large number of websites and communities that specialize in distributing these types of edits.  So over time we have to search until we find the personalization that we like the most.<\/p>\n<p>Once downloaded, it needs to be copied into the game directory:<\/p>\n<p><code class=\"code-section\">%%appdata% &gt; .minecraft &gt; mods<\/code><\/p>\n<p>We can easily copy it in compressed format.  Ready.  Now, as always, we need to open Minecraft from the launcher and load the &#8220;Forge&#8221; profile that appears.  In this way we can start playing the mod.<\/p>\n<h2>Test the beta version of Minecraft<\/h2>\n<p>Despite being over 11 years old, Minecraft is still a money maker.  And that&#8217;s why Microsoft keeps updating the game by adding all kinds of features and functions.  One of the latest additions is ray tracing, or RTX, which makes the game look completely different.<\/p>\n<p><img ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1\" class=\"ezlazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655345924_151_Heres-how-to-download-Minecraft-for-Windows-for-free.jpg\"\/><\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">Although all of these features will reach all users sooner or later, they will first go through the beta branch.  This branch is open to all users, so anyone can subscribe and download it to test these new features before everyone else.  In order to do this, the first thing you have to do is <strong>Sign up for the Xbox Insider Program<\/strong> .  And we need to do this through the Xbox Insider Hub app.<\/p>\n<p><img ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1\" class=\"ezlazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655345924_290_Heres-how-to-download-Minecraft-for-Windows-for-free.png\"\/><\/p>\n<p><img ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1\" class=\"ezlazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655345924_5_Heres-how-to-download-Minecraft-for-Windows-for-free.jpeg\"\/><\/p>\n<p>Developer: Microsoft Corporation<\/p>\n<p>Once inside we look for the entry Minecraft for Windows 10 and enter the insider options that it offers us.  As we will see, all test groups are displayed in the game.  We select the one we want and that&#8217;s it.  For example, we join the RTX group.<\/p>\n<p>Once inside we must go to the Microsoft Store and download Minecraft as usual.  If we already have it installed, in order to download the beta we signed up for, we must update it as an additional app from the store.<\/p>\n<p>We can start playing this version and have access to improvements and news before anyone else.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This game takes us into a sandbox world made up of 3D cubes with no specific objective other than simply <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1012,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1011"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1011"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1011\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1012"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1011"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1011"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1011"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
