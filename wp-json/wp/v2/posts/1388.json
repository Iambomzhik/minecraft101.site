Players can choose a character from a range of heroes and then experience the short prologue. Here the story is outlined, which says that a so-called Illager finds a powerful magical artifact and begins to enslave the world. The task of the players is to save the innocent inhabitants of the world and defeat the monsters and enemy followers. Various locations are traveled through, which are structured like a labyrinth and want to be explored in order to reach the goal and at the same time fight your way through the hordes of opponents using typical Minecraft weapons and other objects.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Pedagogical assessment:<br \/>\n<\/strong>Diablo in Minecraft look?<br \/>\nThe title is structured along the lines of the Hack &amp; Slay genre. The camera perspective shows the action from diagonally above, while the controlled characters move along the ground in all directions. The individual levels are often extensive, but not really complex and intertwined. A map is also available at all times and shows the possible routes. Behind every corner there is either a whole pack of monsters or a few strong ones that want to attack the heroes on sight and prevent them from progressing.<br \/>\nAll elements have the look of the counterparts known from Minecraft. Weapons include swords, axes, pickaxes, bows, crossbows, but also a few new additions. The enemies are also all known, so adventurers will encounter zombies, skeleton shooters, spiders with cobwebs or the notorious creepers, which will blow themselves up near the figure. The requirements are different from the original Minecraft, but the game mechanics are greatly simplified compared to other members of the genre and therefore easy to understand without causing confusion.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Game modes and difficulty<br \/>\nWhile a certain mission always has to be fulfilled in the individual levels, the end of the game comes back to the camp after it has been fulfilled. Here they can catch their breath, check the equipment, exchange items or buy new items for gems from the personal blacksmith. The items that can be found or bought are always random, based only roughly on the level of the hero character and the selected level and level of difficulty. This means that levels can also be replayed multiple times when searching for a specific item. These do not change in terms of content, but are an exact repetition. An increased level of difficulty strengthens and multiplies the opponents, but also promises higher-quality items.<br \/>\nA classic loot spiral is used here in order to provide motivation in addition to the relatively simple background story. In plain language, this means the players fight monsters, get stronger gear with which they defeat stronger monsters, get stronger gear with which they defeat stronger monsters, and so on. Although this is a common practice in titles of this genre, a lot of time can quickly be invested here in order to meet personal requirements and be able to be a little bit stronger. The fact that the receipt of items is still left to chance can also lead to frustration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The multiplayer mode<br \/>\nA special appeal is the possibility of going on a monster hunt with up to four players at the same time. Getting started is very easy, at least in offline mode. Activate the controller, select a character, and the group is reinforced. It can be assumed that this is designed to be barrier-free on all consoles, only on the PC will this only be possible to a limited extent. In the online variant, additional comrades-in-arms can be recruited by receiving an invitation via the friends list. Since the game does not require any lengthy explanations or texts, everything is always explained and the key assignments are visible at all times, the controls are quick and easy to learn. If necessary, this can even be customized.<br \/>\nHowever, there are also some challenges in multiplayer mode that should be considered. Since all the figures move in the same frame, they are in a way forced to move in the same direction. If this does not happen, characters that are too far away will be teleported to each other. It must therefore be agreed on a direction, if this does not work, this situation can also lead to disputes. The same applies to the captured equipment, since this has to be shared among the players. Discussions can also arise here if an understanding is not easily possible. When playing online, however, these challenges do not exist, as everyone has their own framing and also each receives their own loot.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The additional paid content<br \/>\nPaid additional content is planned for the future. On the one hand, new sections of the story are probably offered, which at the same time also bring new areas with them. On the other hand, additional content is already available in the form of visual adjustments. For example, new characters can be unlocked for money. This can also be expanded in the future.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Conclusion:<\/strong><br \/>\nMinecraft Dungeons is a hack &amp; slay adventure set in the Minecraft universe. It offers those interested the game mechanics and the experience of the genre in the characteristic Minecraft look, including cube optics and well-known characters and creatures. The processes and controls are always easy to understand, clearly visible and quick to learn, and freely adaptable if necessary. From a safe camp, the heroes set out to vanquish the monster hordes of the evil Arch-Illager, leveling up from mission to mission and earning more powerful gear. The levels are repeatable and offer different levels of difficulty, which, however, do not change the content of the sections. The element of a loot spiral is used to motivate you to experience the story, which encourages investing more time and can also be frustrating. The multiplayer mode offers a lot of fun, in which up to four warriors can set off. Getting started is uncomplicated and barrier-free, but the mode, especially in the local version, poses the challenge that the group must be able to coordinate independently, otherwise conflicts regarding the direction of movement or the distribution of the loot can lead to conflicts. Paid additional content is also available and planned for the future, this mainly relates to cosmetic adjustments and expansions of the story and the game world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Game description: Minecraft Dungeons is an action-adventure game in the hack &amp; slay genre set in the Minecraft universe.
