But is it safe to play?  You&#8217;ve heard about issues with other games, security and privacy concerns, child protection issues&#8230; but what about Minecraft? <\/p>\n<p>  Is Minecraft safe for kids?  What should parents know about Minecraft and the recommended age rating?  Read on to find the answers. <\/p>\n<h2>Does Minecraft have an age rating?<\/h2>\n<p>  It doesn&#8217;t matter what game your child is playing, you should know the age rating.  When it comes to Minecraft, it&#8217;s easy to get a false sense of security.  After all, it&#8217;s just a sandbox game with degradable building blocks.  Do age ratings really matter? <\/p>\n<p>  Yes, they do. <\/p>\n<p>  In North America, the rating is agreed by the ESRB, while in Europe, PEGI determines the rating.  Ratings are determined based on a game&#8217;s suitability for an audience.  They&#8217;re the video game equivalent of movie ratings. <\/p>\n<p>  The ESRB has stated that Minecraft should be at least 10 years old.  In the PEGI region of Europe (including the European Union, United Kingdom and non-EU countries to the east), Minecraft is rated 7. <\/p>\n<h2>Is Minecraft safe for children?  what you need to know<\/h2>\n<p>  These judgments are clearly based on game mechanics as well as content.  While it is important to follow ESRB and PEGI guidelines, the ultimate decision is yours. <\/p>\n<p>  If you think your kid can handle Minecraft then they should be good to play.  And you can always play along if you want (more on that below). <\/p>\n<p>  Minecraft is therefore aimed at children and is suitable for children around the age of 10.  But is Minecraft safe for kids? <\/p>\n<p>  Minecraft has several game modes.  These allow you to switch between single player, local multiplayer, and remote multiplayer.  This is the last option that can cause problems in protecting children. <\/p>\n<h2>What parents need to know about Minecraft Online<\/h2>\n<p>  Two game options are available in Minecraft (in addition to Survival, Creative and Adventure modes).  The default is single player, which generates a world on the device you are playing on.  This can then be explored, mined, and items built and crafted. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654424627_84_Is-Minecraft-safe-for-children-Minecraft-Parental-Rating-Explained.webp.webp\"\/><\/p>\n<p>  However, two multiplayer modes are also available.  These can be hosted either on your child&#8217;s device or on a remote public server.  Local multiplayer is typically hosted on a single device, allowing other users running Minecraft to connect.  This is relatively safe since all players are on the same network and likely in the same building. <\/p>\n<p>  However, playing Minecraft on a public server is another matter.  This can be difficult for safety reasons. <\/p>\n<p>  Cyberbullies and those who pose a risk to children may use playtime on a public server to target children.  Therefore, there should be a serious discussion between parents about whether a remote public server is a safe gaming environment.  When Minecraft can be just as fun with local gameplay, accessing a public server is pointless. <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>Minecraft Risks: Bullying, Grooming, and Malware<\/h2>\n<p>  It could provide a great gaming environment, but things can get awkward in Minecraft.  It only takes you (or your child) a moment to pick the wrong server, and suddenly a world of bullying, malware, and worse can ensue. <\/p>\n<h2>Bullying in Minecraft<\/h2>\n<p>  Like any online gaming environment, there is also a bullying problem in Minecraft.  If you let your kids play Minecraft online, take the time to check out a server beforehand.  Some are great gaming environments, while others are more clique dominated.  The result can be targeted bullying and antisocial behavior, with some children being lured and manipulated into death scenarios. <\/p>\n<p>  Meanwhile, some Minecraft YouTube videos concern bullying and other inappropriate and unfair behavior of Minecraft.  Therefore, these should also be avoided. <\/p>\n<h2>Care and inappropriate contact in Minecraft<\/h2>\n<p>  Several cases have been highlighted over the years of children being attacked by adults while playing Minecraft online.  This typically uses the messaging service provided by Microsoft, which can be managed and turned off using Xbox Live parental controls. <\/p>\n<p>  If you&#8217;re ready to let your kids play Minecraft online, at least take the time to turn off messaging.  Do this in the app above <strong>Settings > Profile > Manage who can send you invites<\/strong>.  This takes you to the Xbox Live privacy and online safety screen.  Find the <strong>Others can communicate with voice, text or invite option<\/strong> and set up <strong>block<\/strong>.  You might think <strong>friends<\/strong> an acceptable option. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654424627_349_Is-Minecraft-safe-for-children-Minecraft-Parental-Rating-Explained.webp.webp\"\/><\/p>\n<p>  For best results here, consider setting up a child account. <\/p>\n<h2>Malware in Minecraft<\/h2>\n<p>  Kids love skinning Minecraft, but it can be a way to spread malware on your computer.  Malware can be disguised as skins, maps, and mods on third-party websites, resulting in a data security nightmare. <\/p>\n<p>  This usually affects Windows users, although there is a good chance Android devices are also infected. <\/p>\n<p>  The answer is to ensure that only official skin mods and other add-ons and improvements for Minecraft are downloaded. <\/p>\n<h2>Minecraft offline games are safer for kids<\/h2>\n<p>  In simple single player mode, local play is safe and no more tiring than using Lego.  There is no mental or physical risk in playing Minecraft this way. <\/p>\n<p>  This really should be the default option for kids, at least until they get comfortable with the controls.  In single player mode, you don&#8217;t have to worry about the presence of other people in your child&#8217;s world.  It&#8217;s only available on tablet, phone, console, or computer and doesn&#8217;t have an online multiplayer option. <\/p>\n<p>  Note that local multiplayer is available on consoles.  Xbox One and PlayStation 4 offer two options for Minecraft&#8217;s player mode, allowing your child and another person to play in split-screen mode.  This multiplayer option is far safer than online multiplayer modes. <\/p>\n<h2>Play Minecraft with your kids<\/h2>\n<p>  Although Minecraft is intended for children, it&#8217;s a fun experience for all ages.  Because of this, you should spend some time playing it when your kids are in school.  This gives you the opportunity to get a grip on the game.  What now?  Why not play with your kids? <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654424628_544_Is-Minecraft-safe-for-children-Minecraft-Parental-Rating-Explained.webp.webp\"\/><\/p>\n<p>  Better still, you can set up local multiplayer on different devices.  Instead of the split-screen multiplayer of a console, use a mobile device to host a game.  You can even set up your own Minecraft server on a Raspberry Pi, an inexpensive hobby computer. <\/p>\n<p>  However, by hosting your own Minecraft server, you can set the rules, control who accesses the game, and generally remain in control <\/p>\n<h2>Make Minecraft safe for your kids<\/h2>\n<p>  Undoubtedly, the management of Minecraft servers needs more control.  However, you will find that the game has enough controls to help you manage issues.  Banning Minecraft isn&#8217;t worth it, though.  The game has tremendous educational potential, not least with the Minecraft Hour of Code. <\/p>\n<p>  For a safe Minecraft experience, take advantage of single-player and local multiplayer games, and avoid remote-controlled games. <\/p>\n<p>  Would you like to know more about your children?
