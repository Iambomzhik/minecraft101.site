For example, the block &#8220;Earth&#8221; (in the English-language version &#8220;Dirt&#8221; consists of different shades of brown. There are also so-called &#8220;Items&#8221; which usually cannot be placed, such as the &#8220;Stone Sword&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>From what age is Minecraft released?<\/strong><br \/>\nIn principle, Minecraft has no age rating, but there are different game modes, e.g. the creative mode\/gamemode creative or the survival mode\/gamemode survival.  Therefore, in survival mode, there are monsters, also called mobs.  In creative mode, on the other hand, you can simply switch this off with so-called &#8220;cheats&#8221;.  Personally, I would say that the creative mode can be played from 6-8 years old, since you can turn off the mobs with a simple command.  In my opinion, however, you can only play the survival mode with monsters from the age of 9-10, rather from 10.  But it also depends on how sensitive you are.  From this one can conclude that at least I think it is perfectly fine to play Minecraft in the lower grades.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What exact game modes are there?<\/strong><br \/>\nAs already written for the age rating, there is the creative mode, in which you have all the blocks and items in a huge &#8220;inventory&#8221;, and the survival mode, in which you have to collect\/&#8221;farm&#8221; everything yourself.  In addition, there are three other modes, but with the exception of one, they are not very different from the ones already listed.  One is the spectator mode\/gamemode spectator and one is the adventure mode\/gamemode adventure.  With Adventure Mode, certain game actions are restricted.  In spectator mode, you can basically float through everything, but you can&#8217;t really play.  The final game mode, and the one that&#8217;s all the hype right now, is the hardcore game mode.  There is a certain game principle here, because once you &#8220;die&#8221; in the game, you are in spectator mode and can only look at the world and not continue playing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is so special about Minecraft?<\/strong><br \/>\nIn my opinion, the most fascinating thing about Minecraft is that there are almost no limits to what you can do in such a blocky world.  For example, you can build huge houses and churches or explore the world with all its caves, seas and whatever else there is in a Minecraft world.  In summary, I can personally say that there are simply no limits to the imagination and I never run out of ideas!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where exactly can you download the Java Edition of Minecraft and how much does it cost?<br \/>\n<\/strong>To be able to buy the Java Edition you have to go to the following website: &#8220;https:\/\/www.minecraft.net\/de-de\/store\/minecraft-java-edition&#8221;.  Since Minecraft is not free, you have to pay \u20ac23.95 once.  It is best to do this together with your parents.  Before that, you enter your data or that of your parents (e-mail address, first and last name, etc.) and choose your desired user name.  Of course, this must not have been used yet.  Now you pay the \u20ac23.95.  You can pay with the usual payment methods.  After you have paid, you will be directed to a download page.  There you simply download the Java Edition.<\/p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Thanks for reading this post and happy playing Minecraft!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sources: minecraft.net<\/p>\n<p>Felix Hamann-Merz<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to get your parents to play Minecraft Java Edition!
