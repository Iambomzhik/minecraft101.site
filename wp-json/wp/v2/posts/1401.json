So that you can invite your friends into your world, start a new game in the same environment or simply show other players your block world, you use the unique starting value, the seed.  This is a numeric code that you can find in the corresponding field in the settings.  When creating a new world, enter the given seed from our examples here.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone fullwidthelement size-full lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Exciting-Seeds-The-best-worlds-for-Minecraft-PlayStationBlogEurope.jpg\"><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Minecraft\" class=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Exciting-Seeds-The-best-worlds-for-Minecraft-PlayStationBlogEurope.jpeg;charset=UTF-8\"><\/p>\n<p>If you play in survival mode on one of the higher difficulty levels, it will make your life a lot easier if you can find a lot of degradable materials right at the spawn point or a village with hard-working residents without having to search the area for hours.<\/p>\n<p>Of course you can now generate a new world again and again until you have an ideal entry point, or you can use the experience of other Minecrafters and look at their worlds.  Abundant resources, a flying island, shipwrecks and temples right under your nose: here are some of the best worlds in Minecraft.<\/p>\n<h3>Golden times<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-size:140%\" align=\"center\"><strong>Seed: -139003<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At first glance, the starting point seems quite unspectacular and you end up in the middle of an apparently desolate desert landscape.  But right in front of you you will find a temple worth looting.<\/p>\n<p>Go through the entrance and dig a hole in the middle.  But be careful not to dig right under the blue block in the middle, otherwise you will inevitably end up on a pressure plate that will explode TNT blocks shortly afterwards.  Dig one block ahead and you will end up in a treasure chamber with four chests that will give you lots of gold, diamonds, emeralds.  a golden apple, bones and even a diamond horse gear.  That&#8217;s a good start.

In both areas you will find a large settlement and even a harbor after a short walk.  Everything you need at the beginning, safe accommodation, workbenches, butchers, weapon smiths or farmers as well as many different materials is available in the immediate vicinity.<\/p>\n<h3>A flying island<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone fullwidthelement size-full lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/49693735742_a445b93f1a_b.jpg\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size:140%\" align=\"center\"><strong>Seed: 109774369<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>How about building a gigantic monument above the clouds?  As a basis you use the large island that you see floating in front of your eyes right after the start.<\/p>\n<p>In creative mode you can get started right away and, for example, build a gigantic tower that can be seen from afar.  In survival mode you need a way to the clouds, so gather materials and build a stairway to the sky.<\/p>\n<h3>Ship Ahoy<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone fullwidthelement size-full lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/49692892788_5179d5e235_b.jpg\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size:140%\" align=\"center\"><strong>Seed: -1184384676<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Right at your spawn point you will see a mighty shipwreck stranded on an island just waiting to be explored and plundered.<\/p>\n<p>In the chests you will find, for example, paper, quills and a treasure map.  You can then settle down and build your own home in the almost Caribbean environment of several smaller islands.  In the Minecraft &amp; Chill video you can see even more interesting seeds for Minecraft.<\/p>\n<h3>underwater world<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone fullwidthelement size-full lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/49693434381_21f3349433_b.jpg\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size:140%\" align=\"center\"><strong>Seed: 2104241268<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you want to let your creativity run free under water, then you will find exactly the right area with the seed for a wide underwater world.  Immediately after the start, you simply jump into the pixel water and there you will find everything that frolics in the wet water in Minecraft.  You can find these and many other fantastic worlds in the extensive list of VG24\/7.<\/p>\n<h3>Luxurious life<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone fullwidthelement size-full lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/49692890523_5d375486f7_b.jpg\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size:140%\" align=\"center\"><strong>Seed: 2033394339<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, the huge building on the mountain does look a bit spooky, but you can make yourself comfortable here without first having to carry and build lots of materials.  In the mega villa you will find the ideal place for a comfortable and luxurious headquarters over several floors.  The property is populated by a few loitering NPCs and the search for chests is really worthwhile.  You can find this and other exciting seeds at Pro Game Guides, for example.<\/p>\n<h3>How to become a Minecraft Survivor<\/h3>\n<p>Are you just starting out with Minecraft and want to become the absolute block master?
