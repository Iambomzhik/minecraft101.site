Let&#8217;s take a look at all of the above features in this update.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"h.hk4plin0ly1v_l\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q OmQG5e\" tabindex=\"-1\">Features of the new updates Minecraft PE 1.16 and 1.16.200<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\">Many experienced gamers or those who have been playing Minecraft for a long time know that this dimension has not changed since the appearance of the Nether dimension in the world of Minecraft.  This dimension was boring and uninteresting for most players, but everything changed with the release of the long-awaited Nether update.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\">The underworld has received a variety of different changes and improvements ranging from simple plants to large structures and unique mobs.  In the new Nether updates, players could fight new enemy monsters, explore new locations (biomes), structures and blocks.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\">Minecraft PE 1.16 and 1.16.200 is a new update partly dedicated to the world of the Netherlands and the mountains of the Minecraft world.  For example, consider the already familiar Warped Forest biome.  This is a new mystical place in the world of the Netherlands with a variety of interesting structures and blocks.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\">Mountains now have new features too, which you can check out below.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\">First, we turn to two new monsters, namely Strider and Mountain Goat.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\">In the new update of Minecraft PE 1.16 and 1.16.200, these above monsters are worth your attention.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\">First up is Strider, a mob that most commonly lives near the Lava Lake, as well as in all Underworld biomes.  This mob can be very useful for players because after taming this creature, players can saddle up and cross the lava lake.  In order for the player to tame this creature, a warped mushroom must be used.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\">The second creature, namely the mountain goat, appears in the overworld in the mountains.  This crowd also has its own unique characteristics.  For example, his dexterity allows him to move quickly and safely on mountain tops and jump high.  Thanks to their leaps, this crowd can climb to the top of the mountain.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\">We also draw your attention to the fact that a player who invades his territory defends it.  In such cases, a mountain goat can attack the player and smack it with its horns, pushing you back.  By using wheat, players can tame these mobs.  With an empty bucket, players can milk a goat and get milk.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\">Now let&#8217;s look at the new blocks with unique features for the world of Minecraft.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\">With the addition of a specific block in the Nether world, players can not be afraid of dying in this dimension because the player who used to die in the Nether dimension had to return to this world again.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\">This has become much easier now that players can place a new block that allows them to create a spawn point in that dimension.  This block is called Respawn Anchor.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\">The new block allows players to get rid of the constant movement through the portal after each death in the underworld.  The main thing is not to forget to load this block with the glowstone block sometimes.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\">A second no less interesting boulder has been added to the overworld in the mountains, called Powder Snow.  This block is not much different from a simple snow block, but its main feature is that when stepping on it, a crowd or a player can fall through it.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\">This is a new opportunity to build new traps in snowy locations.  In order not to fall in the snow, players can use leather boots.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Minecraft PE 1.16 and 1.16.200 This is a big free update that includes many different changes in the world of <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":581,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/580"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=580"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/580\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1822,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/580\/revisions\/1822"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/581"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=580"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=580"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=580"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
