Or with a friend.  Sometimes I also play a very old Super Mario game on our Wii or Subway Surfer on my father&#8217;s cell phone.  There is also advertising, but I always skip it or put the phone away until then.  Shooting games like &#8220;GTA&#8221; or &#8220;Fortnite&#8221; are not really my thing.  &#8220;Fortnite&#8221; is about shooting other people &#8211; that&#8217;s not so nice.<\/p>\n<p>Some children also play games like &#8220;Fortnite&#8221;, although they are actually still too young for it.  They think it makes them as cool as the older kids.<\/p>\n<p>I like &#8220;Minecraft&#8221; because you don&#8217;t have to shoot and because you can play creatively there.  You can build houses and don&#8217;t have to attack anyone.  It&#8217;s about being able to survive in the wild: you will be teleported somewhere, then you have to try to survive.  You can tame dogs and horses.  And you have to kill cows to get leather, then you can use the leather to make armor.  I think that&#8217;s pretty nice.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of computer games are addictive games, and parents are annoyed that their children keep asking, &#8220;May I play?  May I play?\u201d I was really addicted to \u201cMinecraft\u201d for a long time, but then our computer crashed, at first it was Ende Gel\u00e4nde.  At first I was a bit angry.  But actually it was pretty good for me.<\/p>\n<p>I think parents shouldn&#8217;t get angry if their children play computer games a lot.  They should work out an arrangement with their children, and they should also say \u201cyes\u201d when the children ask if they can play.  Because if they always forbid it, you get even more interested in it!<\/p>\n<p>The parents should also know the games that the children play.  Children don&#8217;t always read what&#8217;s on the back of a game.  Or the case says &#8220;Mickey Mouse&#8221; &#8211; and then there&#8217;s a wrong CD in there, for example from &#8220;GTA&#8221;.  Parents should check this out and ask what the game is about.  In shooting games, it also depends on how hard the game is.  I don&#8217;t think GTA is that great for smaller kids.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At the moment I mostly play &#8220;Minecraft&#8221; on my father&#8217;s or my mother&#8217;s computer.
