This event is all about the developer forge Mojang and its block game <strong>Minecraft<\/strong>.  This year, the Notch team presented the new major update for the PC version.  The new version is called Redstone Update.<\/p>\n<p>As the name suggests, it revolves around the redstone ore, which enables electrical circuits.  The ores should get different signal strengths, which can be combined with the new capacitor.  This gives you the opportunity to build weighted pressure plates and pressure-sensitive rails.  In addition, the mine carts will be improved and new nether ores will be added.  A daylight sensor also finds its way into the block game.  The sensors make solar-like devices possible.<\/p>\n<p>One thing Mojang wants to make true after a long announcement: the mod API.  This will significantly simplify the manufacture and integration of modifications.  The developer wants to deliver a program in time for the update, which is provided free of charge for all users.  With simple clicks it should be possible to install and uninstall modifications.<\/p>\n<p>The Redstone update is planned for January next year.<\/p>\n<p>Minecraft &#8211; update 1.8 trailer<\/p>\n<p>\n        The Xbox version of Minecraft got some new content with the 1.8 update.
