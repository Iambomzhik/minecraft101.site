After Markus Persson and Jakob Porser turned down a job offer at innovation guarantor Valve, Team Mojang was founded and their first work, Minecraft, went public.  That was the start of a phenomenon.<\/p>\n<p>Minecraft is an open-world role-playing game in which the player can choose from different game modes and a single or multiplayer part.  Unlike other games in the genre, which are controlled from the first-person perspective like in Minecraft, there is no predetermined storyline in Minecraft.  Rather, the player invents his own story in his own randomly generated game world and designs it himself.<\/p>\n<p>Different gameplay elements are available for this, of which the sandbox principle certainly had the largest share in the success of Minecraft.  The player can mine raw materials such as earth, wood and others with his hands and use a sophisticated crafting system to produce tools, weapons, food and building components. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Important notes on different Minecraft full versions: Important: There is for that Windows PC several different versions from Minecraft, which <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":444,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/443"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=443"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/443\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/444"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=443"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=443"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=443"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
