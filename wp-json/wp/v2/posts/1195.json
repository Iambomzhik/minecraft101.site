Should I really only allow the latest shooting game because the whole class hangs out in front of it every afternoon? no, right? Experts say: Yes, it can be.<\/p>\n<p>Read more after the ad<\/p>\n<p>Read more after the ad<\/p>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">Again and again there are video games that are not only successful, but become a mass phenomenon: the virtual block digging of &#8220;Minecraft&#8221;, the monster hunt of &#8220;Pok\u00e9mon Go&#8221; and above all &#8220;Fortnite&#8221;, depending on the measurement technology, perhaps the most successful game ever.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">The problem with this: &#8220;Fortnite&#8221; has colorful comic graphics and happily dancing characters. But it&#8217;s also a shooter. Be the last survivor of 100 players to win &#8211; and you only get that by eliminating the competition.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"Headlinestyled__Headline-sc-1ytohq4-0 jBlDvM\">How brutal is Fortnite?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">&#8220;Fortnite already has this competitive spirit, a very combative setting,&#8221; says qualified social worker Daniel Heinz, who heads the game guide NRW. &#8220;Even if the brutality is significantly reduced compared to other shooters.&#8221; In concrete terms, this means: There is shooting, but blood does not flow, and the characters do not die either.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">The recently published classification of the Independent Self-Regulation (USK), which is responsible for the age rating of games in Germany, is correspondingly mild: The so-called free Battle Royale mode, the popular heart of &#8220;Fortnite&#8221;, is like the rest of the game Approved for ages 12 and up.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">&#8220;The agreement on the game date is transparent for 12-year-olds from the start, there are no shocking elements,&#8221; the statement said. On the contrary: The game is so humorous that even 12-year-olds can easily classify what is happening.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">The verdict of the game advisor NRW is not fundamentally different &#8211; but a bit stricter: &#8220;Fortnite: Battle Royale&#8221; is only suitable for young people from the age of 14 at the earliest, it says &#8211; younger people could be overwhelmed or frustrated by the nerve-wracking competition.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\"><b>More on the subject:<\/b> USK gives age rating &#8211; Fortnite approved for ages 12+<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"Headlinestyled__Headline-sc-1ytohq4-0 jBlDvM\">Parents have to make up their own minds<\/h2>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">So even experts are never in complete agreement when it comes to assessing popular games. That&#8217;s why mum and dad can&#8217;t avoid watching the games themselves, says Heinz: &#8220;In discussions like this, parents need a clear position that they can then represent authentically. But that also means getting a comprehensive picture.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">&#8220;If I have a stupid gut feeling about a game, I should express it &#8211; then you can talk about it,&#8221; says family blogger Patricia Cammarata, who writes about games and media in education at www.dasnuf.de, among other things. &#8220;Especially with young people, it is important to remain as specific as possible, otherwise these arguments will not be accepted. And for that I just have to deal with the game.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Recommended Editorial Content<\/p>\n<p class=\"PlaceholderBoxstyled__InfoText-kreiuo-3 goaOmT\">At this point you will find external content from <strong>YouTube<\/strong>, which complements the article.

More on this in our data protection information.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">There are many ways and means. If you want to get to know a game, you don&#8217;t necessarily have to use a controller or smartphone yourself. On the one hand, there are websites such as Spielbar or the NRW game guide that publish texts on current games. There are also live streams or recordings of games, so-called lets-plays, available on platforms such as YouTube and Twitch. And, of course, parents can look over their child&#8217;s shoulder while they are playing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">&#8220;You invest an hour there and then you have a very good impression,&#8221; says Cammarata &#8211; and urgently advocates taking this time: &#8220;It&#8217;s always a little incomprehensible to me when parents don&#8217;t do it &#8211; who wants a new one If you buy a toaster, you sometimes invest five hours in research.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"Headlinestyled__Headline-sc-1ytohq4-0 jBlDvM\">Peer pressure as an argument<\/h2>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">Trained in this way, parents can then engage in discussions with their offspring. But what if the child responds to all concerns with &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s playing!&#8221;? &#8220;When such a hype arises, it can happen that young people feel left out when everyone in the schoolyard is talking about it,&#8221; says Daniel Heinz &#8211; and therefore advises at least not completely wiping the peer pressure argument aside.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">&#8220;The argument that &#8216;everyone&#8217; in the class is playing or using something can certainly count,&#8221; Cammarata agrees. However, she also advises, especially with younger children, to first ask other parents if that is really true. Maybe there are a few gaps between schoolyard bragging rights and reality.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">Sometimes the claim &#8220;all&#8221; is hardly or not at all exaggerated. &#8220;With games like this, hype and distribution fuel each other,&#8221; says Heinz. &#8220;In &#8220;Fortnite&#8221; it eventually spilled down to elementary school, even third graders played it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"Headlinestyled__Headline-sc-1ytohq4-0 jBlDvM\">Bans hardly help<\/h2>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">Parents can of course have concerns at this point at the latest &#8211; despite all the peer pressure arguments. And now? &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in prohibitions,&#8221; says Cammarata. After all, parents can only control what their children do in their own four walls. &#8220;But if the pull is big enough, they&#8217;ll just do it elsewhere &#8211; and I don&#8217;t know if that really makes sense.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">Instead, the experts recommend compromises and middle ground. &#8220;Fortnite is also something you can participate in outside of the game, like watching stuff on YouTube,&#8221; says Cammarata. &#8220;With eight-year-olds who may not really have to play it yet, you say, &#8216;Come on, let&#8217;s look at some things together.&#8217; That often helps them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\"><b>Read more:<\/b> If the child only wants to play computer games \u2013 tips for parents<\/p>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">And the older ones may be able to try it out, although the parents have a stomach ache, the blogger advises &#8211; along the lines of &#8220;Let&#8217;s try it out now, and if you change or neglect your duties, I&#8217;d like to talk about it again.&#8221; Unlimited banging It still doesn&#8217;t have to be, says Heinz, regardless of peer pressure. &#8220;Just because your friend plays Fortnite three hours a day doesn&#8217;t mean your child has to do it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"Textstyled__Text-sc-14jlruk-0 fHMHaZ\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hanover. &#8220;But everyone plays it!&#8221; What seems like a foolproof argument for children and young people makes many parents just <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1196,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1195"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1195"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1195\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1605,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1195\/revisions\/1605"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1196"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1195"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1195"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1195"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
