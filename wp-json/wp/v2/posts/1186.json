That&#8217;s what they say too <strong>censorship<\/strong>.  The opposite of that is the <strong>freedom of the press<\/strong>.  In many countries there is no freedom of the press.  Freedom of the press means that journalists can report on anything and speak their mind.  They must not be hindered in their work by those in power.<\/p>\n<p>The organization &#8220;Reporters Without Borders&#8221; has come up with a project so that crooked deals or bad things that politicians do can also be reported on, even though journalists are being threatened.  The project is called &#8220;<strong>The Uncensored Library<\/strong>\u2019 (pronounced: ansens\u00f6rd laibr\u00e4ri) in German, \u2018The Uncensored Library\u2019.  It is using the popular <strong>Video game Minecraft<\/strong> (pronounced: my powers) were created.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Minecraft?<\/h2>\n<p>Minecraft is a video game.  Millions of people play it every month.  Many of them are children and young people.  Minecraft will be played on a computer, tablet or mobile phone <strong>Buildings and other shapes constructed<\/strong>.  With it you&#8217;ll get <strong>different building blocks<\/strong>. <strong>Whole worlds can be built with these building blocks<\/strong>.  You can even use it to create books.  You can play this computer game alone.  But you can also play it together with others.  You don&#8217;t have to be in one room, you meet in your own &#8220;rooms&#8221; via the Internet.  There you can, for example, share your buildings with other players or have them look at them.<\/p>\n<p>The great thing about Minecraft: <strong>It is also played in countries where there is no freedom of the press<\/strong>.  This is exactly what \u201cReporters Without Borders\u201d use.  They share books and information in such spaces with people in countries where there is no freedom of the press.  There these people can then read the banned books and important information that they cannot get in their country.  This &#8220;library&#8221; on Minecraft mainly deals with the following countries: Mexico, Russia, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.  In these countries there is little freedom of the press.  The library contains around 200 books.  You can download and read them.  Good to know: The uncensored library has been around since March 12, 2020. This is the world day against internet censorship.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is what the &#8220;Uncensored Library&#8221; looks like on Minecraft Photo: https:\/\/www.uncensoredlibrary.com\/de Threats, violence, imprisonment: There are countries in which <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1188,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1186"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1186"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1186\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1188"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1186"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1186"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1186"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
