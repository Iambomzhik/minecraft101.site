The version 1.18.2 offered here can be played as a free demo or after a purchase in the full version.<br \/>\n<br \/>Minecraft Java Edition for Windows<br \/>\n<\/p>\n<h2>Mojang Minecraft Download &#038; Install<\/h2>\n<p>The Minecraft Launcher supports the operating systems Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11 (32-bit\/64-bit).  Requirements are an Intel Core i3-3210 3.2 GHz \/ AMD A8-7600 APU 3.1 GHz or faster, 2 GB RAM and an Nvidia GeForce 400 AMD Radeon HD 7000 with OpenGL 4.4 or better. <\/p>\n<p>Java must also be installed on the system.  Since the launcher loads additional files from the Internet, an existing data connection is also required.\n<\/p>\n<p>A Mojang or &#8211; preferably &#8211; Microsoft account is still required to play.  The following applies: Although the launcher is free, Minecraft itself must be purchased, otherwise only the demo mode is available.  This runs for around 100 minutes, which corresponds to five days in the game world.  If you want to use all game modes without restrictions, you have to pay around 24 euros for the full version in the Minecraft Store.\n<\/p>\n<h2>Download and discover Minecraft<\/h2>\n<p>The basic principle of Minecraft is explained relatively quickly: The entire game world is made up of small blocks.  The digital trees and mountains, meadows and fields always consist of angular units of the same size, but they represent different materials.  These can now be dismantled by the player and reconnected to form new constructions as the mood takes you.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to assembling different blocks, there are of course other ways of using the resources you have worked out in this game.  Just as the name suggests, from the stair step to the mine cart, there are a variety of items in Minecraft that can be crafted using a very simple crafting interface.\n<\/p>\n<h2>Play Minecraft creatively<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to this &#8220;survival mode&#8221;, in which zombies, among other things, make the builder&#8217;s life even more difficult at night, Minecraft also offers a creative mode in which fans of the game can repeatedly create impressive constructions and their own games from the digital block paradise design.  The game also becomes a real multiplayer adventure with a Lego effect via a server connection.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: pure creativity in game form<\/h2>\n<p>Compared to current AAA titles, Minecraft and its incomparable pixel look may seem a bit strange to some at first.  The incomparable game principle, which fully relies on the creativity of the players, makes the game from Mojang a really cult pastime far away from first-person shooters and Co.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Minecraft download installs the Java version of the popular cult game on Windows and invites you to linger creatively <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":389,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/387"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=387"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/387\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/389"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=387"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=387"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=387"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
