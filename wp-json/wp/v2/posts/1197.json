The fundamental question we should ask children as they grow up is no longer what they want to &#8220;be&#8221; but what they would like to &#8220;do&#8221;. What problems can they solve with passion and what are the skills that allow them to achieve their goals.<\/p>\n<p>However, traditional models of education are at odds with this type of thinking. One solution that educators are using to bridge this gap between traditional learning delivery systems and newer workflows and expectations is the <strong>Use of playful learning platforms<\/strong>. Playful learning is very helpful in cultivating a mindset where problem solving becomes a fun activity and failure is seen as a stepping stone.<\/p>\n<h2>Minecraft has sold over 121 million copies<\/h2>\n<p>Minecraft is a game that allows players to construct 3D worlds from textured cubes, but players must explore and gather resources to do so. There are individual and collaborative multiplayer modes. It was originally released in 2011 before being acquired by Microsoft in 2014. To date, it has sold over 121 million copies, second only to Tetris in terms of popularity. Microsoft has since continued to develop Minecraft: Education Edition, which is used in schools and offers additional educational tools and functionalities.<\/p>\n<h2>learning through teaching<\/h2>\n<p>Since many students are already familiar with the platform at home, educators can draw on their own expertise and focus on the learning aspects rather than covering the mechanics of the technology itself. It also triggers situations where &#8220;experienced&#8221; users mentor younger learners and also help teachers who may not be as familiar with the platform as their students, thus encouraging collaborative behavior in the classroom.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/p>\n<h2>Building modular skillsets<\/h2>\n<p>Another benefit of Minecraft is that it helps encourage a modular approach to skill building. As each new problem requires you to find and use different resources, materials, and collaborations, you begin to think of them as pieces of a puzzle that have multiple possible solutions. This is why LEGO and Minecraft have proven so popular and effective in these contexts, since their core design is intrinsically modular.<\/p>\n<p>A recently published survey surveyed teachers from 11 countries and four continents. It showed that the students&#8217; decision-making and communication skills were positively influenced by the time they played Minecraft and that it developed a creative problem-solving attitude.<\/p>\n<p>With Minecraft, starting over is more of a new opportunity than an unfortunate ordeal. Keeping calm and focusing on solving a problem is a skill that can serve students well throughout their academic and professional careers.<\/p>\n<h2>growth thinking<\/h2>\n<p>Interviewed teachers reported that the students using the platform confidently interacted freely during class, often practicing the agency without direction from teachers, and tackling challenges as teams. They found that working through the game made it easier to bridge accessibility issues, as students with different learning styles and abilities were more easily able to find common ground and share what they discovered in multiple formats.<\/p>\n<p>They also felt comfortable experimenting and saw failure as part of the creative learning process. This resilience and growth mentality is well recognized by employers as a desirable trait, especially in innovative industries like technology.<\/p>\n<p>Paradoxically, however, the more teachers and students use the Minecraft platform to provide educational content and enhance learning outcomes, the less value they place on the game itself. As is often the case with successful technology solutions, the measure of their success depends on how invisible they will and let the contents shine through.<\/p>\n<h2>Social Emotional Learning<\/h2>\n<p>Given how video games are often found to be socially isolating, it&#8217;s somewhat surprising that one of the areas most dramatically improved through the Minecraft collaboration was Social and Emotional Learning (SEL).<\/p>\n<p>A study conducted by Microsoft has shown that a growing number of schools across the SEL are adopting an approach that builds skills and competencies that help students thrive in school, work, and life.<\/p>\n<p>In the context of K-12 education, SEL is the process through which students acquire and effectively apply the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to understand and manage emotions, set, and achieve positive goals feeling and showing empathy for others, building and maintaining positive relationships, and making responsible decisions.<\/p>\n<p>SEL initiatives thrive when incorporated into subjects throughout the curriculum during the traditional school day to address real-world problems, or at least problems that feel &#8220;real&#8221; to students.<\/p>\n<p>Research has shown that students exposed to SEL are better able to self-manage, have a better understanding of others&#8217; perspectives and ability to relate to them effectively, and are able to make informed decisions about personal and social choices.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1655550094_361_Is-Minecraft-the-future-of-education.jpg\" alt=\"minecraft pig\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Social emotional learning comes alive when knowledge is used to solve relevant problems, whether in the context of real scenarios or disguised as a game. One of the best examples is how students had to use basic chemistry to get materials like latex. This in turn can be used to craft balloons. And these balloons can be attached to the cranky pigs that populate the game (once you manage to catch them). This makes it easier for students to remember the chemical components of latex.<\/p>\n<h2>Empathy through play<\/h2>\n<p>Through Minecraft, educators have the opportunity to help students develop empathy through play, imagining how they would like to be treated, going through scenarios in play and in their personal lives, and discussing how they would do something differently (or be treated differently). wanted to become), and then to practice those skills. Technology doesn&#8217;t hinder our ability to build relationships; conversely, with regard to classroom play, it can serve to further strengthen them.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The pedagogical way of playing gives insight into a fundamental change in mentality that teachers and learners have to go <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1198,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1197"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1197"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1197\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1604,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1197\/revisions\/1604"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1198"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1197"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1197"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1197"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
