We&#8217;ll never know for sure, but I suspect it&#8217;s because the Nether is so dark. Larger eyes mean more light can be picked up, allowing ghasts to spot a player from a greater distance. Especially when that player sneaks across a one-block-wide bridge high above a lava lake to reach a remote Glowstone &#8211; let&#8217;s face it, a situation we&#8217;ve all been in before.<\/p>\n<p>However, things have changed a bit in the Nether update. The Nether isn&#8217;t so dark anymore &#8211; giant mushrooms have started to sprout in crimson forests and warped forest biomes and it&#8217;s brightening everything up. Why? Well, because giant mushrooms have a weird fruiting body that glows in the dark &#8211; our block of the week, the Mushroom Light.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Mushroom Lights can be found in the upper branches of giant mushrooms that grow in Crimson and Warped Forests. Regardless of the biome you are in, the Mushroom Lights themselves are identical, which is an odd evolutionary quirk. They are found in both manufactured and bonemeal grown mushrooms.<\/p>\n<p>do you want one Then hit it until it falls. Want one VERY FAST? Then I hope you brought a hoe, as this is the most effective way to pry the mushroom light from the stem. Thankfully, the Mushroom Light will continue to glow even after removal, so you&#8217;ll be able to bring it home and still get the most out of her Light Shining ability in your Mushroom-inspired builds.<\/p>\n<p>Or you could just compost it. Mushroom Lights have a 65% chance to increase the composter&#8217;s level by one. All that glow must be good for plant growth?<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.minecraft.net\/content\/dam\/franchise\/photography\/things\/shroomlight-realworld.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are many glow-in-the-dark mushrooms in the real world &#8211; more than 75 known species were last counted. Plants and animals that glow are called &#8220;bioluminescent,&#8221; and the phenomenon is believed to have many functions &#8211; from attraction and defense to communication and mimicry. In the case of fungi, it may attract insects, which then spread the spores. On the other hand, that might not be the case. Mushroom scientists aren&#8217;t really sure.<\/p>\n<p>The species pictured above is the &#8220;bitter oyster mushroom&#8221;, better known as Panellus stipticus, which grows on logs, stumps and trunks of deciduous trees in Asia, Australia, Europe and North America. Interestingly, only the strains growing in eastern North America are bioluminescent &#8211; those on the Pacific coast and other continents are not.<\/p>\n<p>Bitter Oyster Mushrooms have another superpower &#8211; namely that they can break down some hazardous industrial waste into safer chemicals, making them very useful on heavily contaminated soil. We don&#8217;t recommend wandering through derelict sites at night, but if you do and see a patch of glowing mushrooms, it might be a good idea to turn back&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A fluorescent mushroom?
