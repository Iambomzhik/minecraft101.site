These sites can be castles, temples or villages, as you already know.  Many users want to know how to find a village in Minecraft, since they don&#8217;t know how to do it in the well-known game.  Luckily, there are multiple methods you can use to find a village in this universe.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">Inhabited locations are of great importance <strong>because they are places where you can trade.<\/strong> Therefore, it is important that we find one when we play Minecraft.  Villages are possibly the most important inhabited places since they are home to villagers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">When asked how to find a village in Minecraft, we have several answers.  We have<strong> four ways to do it<\/strong> this within the known game.  This allows each user to choose the method they find the easiest based on their skill and experience in this game.  These four methods that we will explain to you below will allow you to find a slope in the wide world of the game.<\/p><source type=\"image\/webp\" data-lazy-  http:=\"\"><img width=\"100\" height=\"56\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654452577_253_How-to-find-a-village-in-Minecraft-all-paths.jpg\"\/><\/source><\/p>\n<p>Related articles:<\/p>\n<p>How to get bees and honey in minecraft<\/p>\n<h2>aspects to consider<\/h2>\n<p>Before we delve fully into this matter, we need to consider a few aspects.  So that we avoid looking for a village in this universe without having luck in this search.  There are a number of previous steps that we must perform or verify in order for these websites to be found:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>debes <b>Activate random structures<\/b> in the options before playing survival mode.  This allows you to see the inhabited places that are in the biome.<\/li>\n<li><b>Not all biome types can be inhabited<\/b>.  In Minecraft there will only be people (villagers) in the taiga, plain, savanna and desert.<\/li>\n<li>The larger the biome, the more likely there are inhabited places like villages in it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How to find a village in Minecraft?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"gt-block\"><strong>In a biome there can be inhabited places like villages<\/strong>.  You can never be sure that there is a village, so in many cases we must take into account that there is a high probability that there is a village and therefore start this search in the game.  As mentioned earlier, there are a total of four methods you can use to do this.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">None of these methods will lead us to find the village directly, at least not always, but they are a good help to follow.  In most cases we will be placed very close to this village, which will save us a lot of time in this process.It&#8217;s good to know more about how each of these methods works because surely you will use more. <strong>We will tell you more about each of these methods<\/strong> individually below.<\/p>\n<h3>Use the Chunkbase page<\/h3>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">The first method that we can use is Chunkbase page where you will find a tool that will allow you to find villages in the game.  The aim of this page is that users can find a village in minecraft.  It&#8217;s unfortunately not the most accurate site in this search, but in many cases it can get us pretty close to the location of a village.  So it&#8217;s still a good help.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">If you have created a world, it is recommended to use the seed number in this case.  For the PC Java version, <strong>You can use the command<\/strong> <strong>\/seeds<\/strong> in the chat console to access the number of the world you are playing, which you will then use.  It&#8217;s an important fact, so you might as well write it down.  If you are unable to use the command, return to the main menu after the world is created.  Select your game, click &#8220;Redo&#8221;, click &#8220;More world options&#8221; and then you can see your game&#8217;s seed number on the screen.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">If you have this number, you need to enter it in the \u00abSeed\u00bb slot on the Chunkbase website.  You need to put the version of the game you&#8217;re playing in your case, which is important in this regard.  The option is under the coordinates map on the right.  Then click on the blue button \u00abFind Villages!\u00bb  and a series of dots will appear on the map.  Points <strong>represent the villages in an approximate position on the map.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you want to know the coordinates of one of these points, you simply have to move the mouse over the point in question.  You need to look at the XZ numbers that appear on the lower left side of the map and this village can be found on the map.  It&#8217;s good that you write down these numbers because they will definitely help you find a village in Minecraft.<\/p>\n<h3>Teleportation and village location tricks<\/h3>\n<p><source type=\"image\/webp\" data-lazy-  http:=\"\" data-lazy-><img alt=\"minecraft-find-village\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\"  data-lazy- src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654452577_533_How-to-find-a-village-in-Minecraft-all-paths.jpg\"\/><\/source><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">It may be that you already know the coordinates of a village in Minecraft, or at least approximate coordinates.  If so, you can use this trick to find or reach it.<strong> This trick is the \/teleport or \/tp command<\/strong>.  This command is divided into several sections: \/tp [Ihr Name] XY Z. First you need to write the name, respecting the case.  Then you need to write down each number of the coordinate where this village is located in turn.  If it contains a negative number, you must use the corresponding symbol, otherwise you will end up in a different point on this map and very far from this village.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you are in a game and don&#8217;t want to leave it, you can also use the \/locate command.  For PC and Spanish, the trick is \/locate Aldea, respecting capital letters at all times.  If you&#8217;re playing from mobile phones or English versions of the game, use the \/locate village command.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">What this command does is <strong>Find the village closest to your current position<\/strong>.  However, it is common that you only get the values \u200b\u200bfor the XZ coordinates, i.e. no information about the position of Y.  If you want to use the teleport function, you will have to experiment with other values \u200b\u200bfor Y. If you remain buried, you will have to dig quickly.  Also, it&#8217;s best to avoid going too high, otherwise you risk dying from the corresponding drop.<\/p>\n<h3>Use a known seed<\/h3>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">If you don&#8217;t want to create a new world in Minecraft, you can use an additional option.  I know<strong> You can use a seed that you know well<\/strong>.  As you may already know, we came across a few of them on the internet.  In many cases, these seeds are filled with villages and inhabited areas where you can trade with their residents.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">By using many of these seeds, <strong>You will see that it starts right in a city<\/strong>, making the process much easier and saving time as well.  If you decide to use this method, it is important that you get the correct seed number when creating a world.  It&#8217;s a common mistake that can have serious consequences.<\/p>\n<h3>explore for yourself<\/h3>\n<p><source type=\"image\/webp\" data-lazy-  http:=\"\" data-lazy-><img alt=\"Bees and Honey Minecraft\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\"  data-lazy- src=\"https:\/\/minecraft101.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654452577_253_How-to-find-a-village-in-Minecraft-all-paths.jpg\"\/><\/source><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">The fourth and final method is the most traditional and takes the longest.  It&#8217;s about E<strong>Explore the game world yourself in search of said village<\/strong>.  Something that works in all versions of the game.  Although it is a method that requires more work and patience, many users prefer not to use it.  Although there are some ways to make this more bearable and save time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">Se recomienda que <strong>Get a mount as soon as possible<\/strong>, as this makes exploration faster.  In addition, it is important that you only look in the biomes of plains, savannas, deserts and taiga, because as we have said before, these are the areas where we know we can find villages in the game.  So we will focus on these biomes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">If you&#8217;ve decided to explore, there&#8217;s a trick that will be of great help.  Open the in-game chat console and type \/gamemode creative <strong>Activate Minecraft creative mode<\/strong>.  In this mode, press the jump button twice.  This allows you to hover and see the world around you better.  Finding a village will be much easier from above, so this process will be done a little faster thanks to this simple trick.  You will save a lot of time searching for a village.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to write this cheat is to replace &#8220;creative&#8221; with &#8220;c&#8221; or &#8220;1&#8221;.  If you want to return to survival mode, type \/gamemode survival.  You can change &#8220;Survival&#8221; to &#8220;s&#8221; or &#8220;0&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Finding inhabited locations is essential in Minecraft.
