Minecraft is a game that needs no introduction.  This fan base might not take lightly the fact that Mojang has decided to increase the prices of Minecraft in some regions.  It has more to do with economics than Minecraft trying to make more money selling Minecraft.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"can-you-still-get-minecraft-windows-10-for\">Can you still get Minecraft Windows 10 for free?<\/h2>\n<p>Minecraft for Windows 10.

You can play with up to four other people running Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition or Pocket Edition on your local network.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"can-you-play-java-minecraft-on-windows-10\">Can you play Java Minecraft on Windows 10?<\/h2>\n<p>Your existing Minecraft experience will not change at all, and the Windows 10 edition is not intended as an upgrade for your existing game.  However, you cannot currently play your Java PC\/Mac worlds on Windows 10 Edition.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"is-minecraft-good-for-kids\">Is Minecraft good for kids?<\/h2>\n<p>As an open-ended building game with seemingly endless possibilities, Minecraft can be powerfully addicting.  Even &#8220;good&#8221; games can be played in excess, and homework, chores, family responsibilities, and real-world social activities can take a backseat when children can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t quit.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-allocate-more-memory-to-minecraft\">How do I allocate more memory to Minecraft?<\/h2>\n<p>Go to the Startup Options tab and enable the Advanced Settings option.

Versions of Minecraft that don&#8217;t support cross-play, such as the original Java-based Mac\/PC version and the Wii U version, will keep their &#8220;Edition&#8221; subtitles.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-the-difference-between-minecraft-and\">What is the difference between Minecraft and Minecraft Windows 10?<\/h2>\n<p>Minecraft Windows 10 Edition is effectively Minecraft PE (Pocket Edition), which one of your comments indicates you&#8217;ve played.  Minecraft Windows 10 Edition is basically a port of Minecraft PE.  It&#8217;s cheaper than the PC edition but lacks the key features of the PC edition (modding).<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-you-install-mods-on-minecraft-windows\">How to install mods on minecraft windows 10?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"gt-block\"><strong>How to Install Minecraft PE Addons\/Mods for Windows 10 Edition<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Locate the file [Add-on] More Chairs By Genta.zip on your computer. <\/li>\n<li>Select both folders, then click Extract.<\/li>\n<li>Choose the location where you want to extract the two folders, or use the default folder. <\/li>\n<li>Open your Downloads folder again and locate the folder [Textures] More Chairs by Genta.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2 id=\"can-windows-10-minecraft-play-with-java-on\">Can windows 10 play minecraft with java on realms?<\/h2>\n<p>You can subscribe to Minecraft Realms with the latest Bedrock Engine-based version of Minecraft found on mobile, VR devices, Nintendo Switch consoles, Xbox consoles, and Windows 10 computers.
