In and of itself not an earth-shattering feature, but this function has been requested since the alpha in mid-2009 and has not yet been implemented.<\/p>\n<p><b>Update 01\/14\/15:<\/b> Only a few more weeks and you can finally change your username in Minecraft. According to an FAQ on Mojang.com, the change is possible free of charge from 2\/4\/15. 37 days after you changed the name, the original one will be shared with other users. Until then, you have the opportunity to undo the name change if you like your old one better. For more answers to pressing questions, visit the Minecraft Name Change FAQ.<\/p>\n<p>N \/ A? Tired of running around as Twerkboy69 in Minecraft? The option to change profile names in Minecraft is coming soon. There is no exact date for this feature at the moment, but it will not appear before Update 1.8. Mojang&#8217;s Kristoffer Jelbring posted an image on Twitter as a teaser for the name change. A few minutes later, he had to explain to fans that &#8220;Minecraft name change&#8221; didn&#8217;t mean that the name of the game should change.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"de\"><p>No we&#8217;re not changing the name of the game.
