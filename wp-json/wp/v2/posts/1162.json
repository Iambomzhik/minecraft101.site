They react quickly and skilfully, hold the others against it. One thing is certain: they worry, at least for many parents, whose children can no longer let go of &#8220;Pok\u00e9mon Go&#8221;, &#8220;Minecraft&#8221; or &#8220;Clash of Clans&#8221;. Your arguments come from different directions. Sometimes there are no real arguments at all, just an uneasy feeling. And then an announcement.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p class=\"atc-TextParagraph\">So it&#8217;s worth taking a closer look \u2013 and sorting it out a bit. Some parents find that their children generally spend too much time on their smartphones or in front of the computer. Whether it&#8217;s about Snapchat and WhatsApp, whether they watch videos, gamble or maybe even get information, doesn&#8217;t matter at first. It makes a difference whether you do research for homework, have something explained to you online or chat with friends. And even when gambling, there are still enormous differences &#8211; between a pure shooting game and one in which you also have to think along, for example. Not to mention the games that are developed to educate (e.g. math) or educate (e.g. the situation of refugees). Sometimes screen games are even used to help sick people, that also exists.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"atc-SubHeadline\">The worlds behind glass cannot offer that<\/h3>\n<p class=\"atc-TextParagraph\">However, there are also games that, if you ignore the fun and excitement, you can&#8217;t get much good out of them. Even some that really upset us or put us under pressure \u2013 because things can happen, even with our own characters, that scare us; because winning or losing means a lot to us; or because the game just keeps going even when we&#8217;re not on, only then we can&#8217;t react and play along. Of course, parents want to know if their children spend their time with it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"atc-TextParagraph\">There are developmental psychologists, researchers who study what happens to our minds as we grow up, who object to children being exposed to digital devices. Their argument: In childhood, the development of the brain literally has to do with understanding. Children need to be able to touch, move, balance and climb in order for their brains to develop well. And the world behind the glass of the screen or touchscreen just can&#8217;t offer that.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"atc-SubHeadline\">Bad news, good way<\/h3>\n<p class=\"atc-TextParagraph\">There are brain researchers who say the insidious thing about entertainment offered by computers, smartphones and tablets is that they target the &#8220;reward center&#8221; in our brain over and over again. As a result, we can&#8217;t get enough of some games. There are even researchers who say that playing computer games stimulates parts of our brains in such a way that even things just learned can be lost in the process. Bad news for everyone who wants to reward themselves with a round of computer games after preparing for a test.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"tsr-Base_ContentMetaList\">\n<li class=\"tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem-author\">Niklas Zaboji<\/li>\n<li class=\"tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem-time-of-publication\">Published\/Updated:<\/li>\n<li class=\"tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem-social-feedback\">recommendations: 4<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul class=\"tsr-Base_ContentMetaList\">\n<li class=\"tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem-author\">Fridtjof K\u00fcchemann<\/li>\n<li class=\"tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem-time-of-publication\">Published\/Updated:<\/li>\n<li class=\"tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem-social-feedback\">recommendations: 12<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul class=\"tsr-Base_ContentMetaList\">\n<li class=\"tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem-author\">Jonas Jansen, Cologne<\/li>\n<li class=\"tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem-time-of-publication\">Published\/Updated:<\/li>\n<li class=\"tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem tsr-Base_ContentMetaItem-social-feedback\">recommendations: 5<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"atc-TextParagraph\">But there are also counts, like the one recently in Australia, which show that children who play screen games can read and do arithmetic better. Which of course doesn&#8217;t mean that computer games make you smart. Everything is not so easy. It is perhaps easiest if both sides, parents and their children, talk more about what computer games mean to them. Exactly what is being played and why, what is good about it, what are the concerns. And then together you can look for a way that doesn&#8217;t ignore the concerns of the parents or the wishes of the children. Both are important. It&#8217;s true, what comes out of it are rules &#8211; about daily or weekly game times, for example. And who likes rules? But if you think about the fact that they help to avoid bids and cheating, which are things that often lead to arguments and bad moods, then maybe they&#8217;re not so bad after all.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you follow scientific studies, what have screen games not already done: violent, fat and stupid, some say.
