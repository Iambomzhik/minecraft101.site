										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fluorescent mushroom?<br />
Why do ghasts have such big eyes? We&#8217;ll never know for sure, but I suspect it&#8217;s because the Nether is so dark. Larger eyes mean more light can be picked up, allowing ghasts to spot a player from a greater distance. Especially when that player sneaks across a one-block-wide bridge high above a lava lake to reach a remote Glowstone &#8211; let&#8217;s face it, a situation we&#8217;ve all been in before.</p>
<p>However, things have changed a bit in the Nether update. The Nether isn&#8217;t so dark anymore &#8211; giant mushrooms have started to sprout in crimson forests and warped forest biomes and it&#8217;s brightening everything up. Why? Well, because giant mushrooms have a weird fruiting body that glows in the dark &#8211; our block of the week, the Mushroom Light.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mushroom Lights can be found in the upper branches of giant mushrooms that grow in Crimson and Warped Forests. Regardless of the biome you are in, the Mushroom Lights themselves are identical, which is an odd evolutionary quirk. They are found in both manufactured and bonemeal grown mushrooms.</p>
<p>do you want one Then hit it until it falls. Want one VERY FAST? Then I hope you brought a hoe, as this is the most effective way to pry the mushroom light from the stem. Thankfully, the Mushroom Light will continue to glow even after removal, so you&#8217;ll be able to bring it home and still get the most out of her Light Shining ability in your Mushroom-inspired builds.</p>
<p>Or you could just compost it. Mushroom Lights have a 65% chance to increase the composter&#8217;s level by one. All that glow must be good for plant growth?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.minecraft.net/content/dam/franchise/photography/things/shroomlight-realworld.jpg" /></p>
<p>There are many glow-in-the-dark mushrooms in the real world &#8211; more than 75 known species were last counted. Plants and animals that glow are called &#8220;bioluminescent,&#8221; and the phenomenon is believed to have many functions &#8211; from attraction and defense to communication and mimicry. In the case of fungi, it may attract insects, which then spread the spores. On the other hand, that might not be the case. Mushroom scientists aren&#8217;t really sure.</p>
<p>The species pictured above is the &#8220;bitter oyster mushroom&#8221;, better known as Panellus stipticus, which grows on logs, stumps and trunks of deciduous trees in Asia, Australia, Europe and North America. Interestingly, only the strains growing in eastern North America are bioluminescent &#8211; those on the Pacific coast and other continents are not.</p>
<p>Bitter Oyster Mushrooms have another superpower &#8211; namely that they can break down some hazardous industrial waste into safer chemicals, making them very useful on heavily contaminated soil. We don&#8217;t recommend wandering through derelict sites at night, but if you do and see a patch of glowing mushrooms, it might be a good idea to turn back&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bunnies are passive mobs in Minecraft. They drop loot and run away from players who get too close. That may be the case for all rabbits now, but it wasn&#8217;t always like this. Once upon a time there was the killer rabbit. The Killer Bunny was a hostile mob characterized by a few distinctive features. First it was always a white rabbit. Bunnies come in different colors in Minecraft, but the Killer Bunny was always white. Secondly, unlike other rabbits, it had red and horizontal eyes. This rabbit is no longer in play, but can be summoned.</p>
<p>The Summon command is good for summoning any mob that is allowed in the game. The only mobs not available on all platforms are the Giant Zombie and Killer Bunny, which are Java exclusives. How to summon the Killer Bunny in Minecraft.</p>
<h2>Summon the Killer Bunny in Minecraft</h2>
<p>The syntax for using the Summon command is /summon [spawnPos: x y z]“. This can be a little tricky, but the location tags aren&#8217;t strictly necessary. They can be used to set the exact spawn location, but it&#8217;s not always required.</p>
<p>Summoning the Killer Bunny involves summoning a rabbit with certain specifications: &#8220;/summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType:99}&#8221; is the syntax for this command. The Killer Bunny is referred to as Type 99 in Minecraft. It will appear with the appropriate name tag and will immediately become hostile.</p>
<p>The Killer Bunny will be hostile to players, foxes, and wolves. It leaps at players within a 16 block radius at a higher speed than a normal rabbit. If it manages to get close to a player, it deals four hearts of damage on Normal difficulty. The Killer Bunny retreats after being hit, but soon returns to attack. It is immune to the Thorns enchantment. If there are no players in range, it will go after other mobs, even tamed wolves.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">So who remembers the killer rabbit in Minecraft</p>
<p>— soop || Calm in Power SOPHIE (@Soopertartory) October 30, 2020</p></blockquote>
<p>Unlike other hostile mobs, a peaceful environment will not cause them to disappear. However, it will stop attacking mobs and players. Just like other rabbits, it will follow players holding carrots and it can even be bred.</p>

		<title>10 Creepy Minecraft Myths That Might Be True</title>

					<description><![CDATA[The block game, which is a bit reminiscent of Lego, has been very popular for several years. Hardly any game ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The block game, which is a bit reminiscent of Lego, has been very popular for several years.  Hardly any game was bought as often as the sandbox game.  But even in a beautiful world where you can do whatever you want, not everything is always rosy and beautiful.  For that reason, here are 10 creepy Minecraft myths that might be true.</p>
<h2>Herobrine</h2>
<p>Of course, this myth should not be missing from this list and belongs right at the top.  Herobrine is considered one of the most exciting and most discussed myths in the entire gaming world.  The legend revolves around the character Herobrine, but what exactly is Herobrine?</p>
<p>Herobrine is a creature that looks very similar to the original player character, Steve.  In addition to Steve&#8217;s normal appearance, Herobrine has glowing white eyes.</p>
<p>There are almost more legends about the character Herobrine than zombies in a cave.  For example, he should be able to kill the player in one hit despite the best armor.  In other theories he is said to be the devil and in some even the god of this world who is enraged by your presence.</p>
<p>But no matter where it comes from or what exactly it is, beware if your mirror suddenly speaks to you.</p>
<h2>Entity 303</h2>
<p>This creature is often thought of as Herobrine&#8217;s little brother.  Like Herobrine, he is said to have the character of a player.  This time, however, he doesn&#8217;t look like Steve.  He wears a white suit and has an all-black face.</p>
<p>But where does this creepy creature come from?</p>
<p>According to the legends, Entity 303 is a former Mojang employee.  According to legend, after being fired from Notch a few years ago, he now wants revenge on his game.</p>
<p>His abilities are said to be very similar to Herobrine&#8217;s.</p>
<p>However, the scariest thing about this creature is that it will spam your chat before and while it appears.  In your chat you can then read the line &#8220;Make a wish&#8221; again and again.  This sentence is rumored to allude to the horror film Wish Upon, in which every wish has deadly consequences.</p>
<p>Entity 303 may also have deadly consequences for you or your character.</p>
<h2>A cross does not mean anything good</h2>
<p>This theory is more or less about building your world in the game.  According to this legend, some parts of your beautiful world are said to be more dangerous than others.</p>
<p>Whenever part of the landscape is a cross, it may not be the best place for you to stay.  The wildest fan theories say that there are more monsters waiting for you there.  In addition, there should also be other monsters like ghosts and traps should be waiting for you on every corner.</p>
<p>So it is better to take a good look at your building plot before this cross represents your tombstone.</p>
<h2>The mad professor</h2>
<p>As an experienced Minecraft player, it has probably happened to you hundreds of times.  You&#8217;re standing comfortably in a mine, knocking your diamonds out of the wall and suddenly it starts hissing behind you.  In most cases, this is the moment when you already know that all your previous efforts have been in vain.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re talking about the creepers.  Those horrid creatures that sneak up behind you and blow up in a matter of seconds.  But where do these green spoilsports come from?</p>
<p>After all, most of the other monsters, such as zombies, skeletons, and giant spiders, still have reasonable explanations.</p>
<p>According to a fan theory, there is an enemy in Minecraft who is usually called &#8220;The Mad Prof.&#8221; within this legend.  He&#8217;s supposed to spend every day in his lab growing these walking explosive traps.</p>
<p>Even if no player has ever seen this professor, this assumption cannot be completely ruled out.  It may be found where there is a lot of sand.  After all, he needs a TNT block for every creeper.</p>
<h2>The last disc</h2>
<p>This theory is also based on Herobrine&#8217;s theory.  It should be possible to find a very specific record within the game.</p>
<p>This record is designed to play the same tune that you hear when Herobrine walks towards you.</p>
<p>By the way, Herobrine should feel insulted by playing this record and start hunting you very soon.  So find better other music before you have to pay with your life for your last song.</p>
<h2>Steve is an experiment</h2>
<p>As the friendly and well-disposed Steve, we make the block world unsafe right from the start.  We chop down trees with the edge of our hands, break the necks of cows with three or four blows, and can burn for up to a minute without dying.</p>
<p>All in all, that doesn&#8217;t sound human at all.  Also, he seems to be the only human who can move freely throughout the game.  The movements of the other people always look like this (warning bad joke) pre-programmed.</p>
<p>But how is it that Steve seems to be able to do much more than a normal person?  Is it the raw meat diet?  Or the constant brawls with zombies, creepers and skeletons?</p>
<p>Many fans believe they have found the solution in their theory.  Steve should therefore not be a human, but a human-like being from an experiment.</p>
<p>After the experiment, he is said to have been abandoned on a strange earth-like planet, where he is being observed by scientists and doctors to monitor his success and vital functions.  This theory also states that Steve doesn&#8217;t actually respawn, but rather a new version of himself is sent to the planet.  Quasi a Steve 2.0.</p>
<p>The development studio has not yet commented on this theory, even if it would be a good explanation for the legend of Herobrine.  It could then be a failed experiment that eventually became malicious and developed a will of its own.</p>
<h2>Atlantis, the Leviathan and the sea</h2>
<p>As you explore your randomly generated world, you will eventually come across a large ocean.  According to some rumours, you can experience quite a bit there.  There are said to be ancient ruins of the sunken city of Atlantis.  These are guarded by the guards, who you have to hunt down before they finish you off.</p>
<p>There is also said to be a hidden treasure chest, but it is guarded by a Leviathan.</p>
<p>While there is no file in the Minecraft files that would suggest a Leviathan, Notch may have hidden it too well to keep the myth alive.</p>
<p>However, underwater ruins that bear a certain resemblance to Atlantis have now been confirmed.  There you will also find chests that sometimes contain more and sometimes less valuable things.</p>
<h2>Damage from another dimension</h2>
<p>This situation has happened to many players.  You&#8217;re walking peacefully across a plain or a mountain and suddenly you&#8217;re getting damage from somewhere.  While it&#8217;s not much (around 1-2 hearts depending on armor), you can&#8217;t see where this damage is coming from.</p>
<p>There was no thorn bush, no cactus and no hidden mobs were waiting for you anywhere.</p>
<p>Various fans have already tried to find a logical explanation for this mystery.  They came up with the strangest ideas.  Except for the bores who just think it&#8217;s a bug, most fans assume it&#8217;s Herobrine or Entity 303.  They are supposed to jump out of another dimension, hit you and then immediately vanish into thin air.</p>
<p>Other fans also suspect it&#8217;s an unknown enemy that&#8217;s even harder to beat than an Enderman.  No matter what it is, it can definitely become very dangerous and very frustrating when you end up running across the desert at your wits end and your last heart is shattered by such a blow.</p>
<h2>Back to sea</h2>
<p>For the penultimate spooky myth you have to go to the open sea again.  In addition to the already mentioned ruins, there are also monuments and monuments under water.  These are guarded by a guard.</p>
<p>This guardian will not harm you, but he will definitely teach you to fear.  As soon as you venture near such a monument (about 50 blocks), a sudden jumpscare appears and you probably get wet.</p>
<p>In addition, this guardian applies one of two curses that either slow you down or even completely stop you.  So he makes it very clear to you that you really have no business there.  But isn&#8217;t the temptation all the greater if there is an express ban?</p>
<h2>The Abandoned Village</h2>
<p>Villages in Minecraft have become more beautiful and diverse with each update since their introduction.  Be it the trading function with the residents or the opportunity to get some fruit and vegetables without having to grow them yourself.</p>
<p>But there is also the perfect counterpart to this idyll.  We are talking about the abandoned villages.  Almost all clichés of a ghost town are served here without exception.  From destroyed houses, to spider webs on every corner, to traces of a sudden flight of the former inhabitants.</p>
<p>After a short time in such a ghost village, however, you will find that not all residents have fled.  Some stayed behind and, well let&#8217;s call it, adapted to the circumstances.</p>
<p>They became Zombie Villagers.  For this reason, extreme caution is required when you go in search of valuable resources in such a village.  After all, you never know who or what is behind you.</p>
<p>Whether you want to face these ten myths and legends is up to you to decide.  Some of them may be true while others are most likely fictional.  Do you dare to find out which of these myths are true?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dodge the slime shooter and defeat your opponent to win the golden apple and go head-to-head with the killer rabbit ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dodge the slime shooter and defeat your opponent to win the golden apple and go head-to-head with the killer rabbit to get the healing potions and a chest with a shield and bow.  Enjoy the exciting Minecraft adventures that await you with LEGO Minecraft The Skull Arena (21145), specially designed for fans of the hugely successful video game.</p>
<p>This is how one of the latest LEGO Minecraft sets is advertised in the LEGO online shop.  The Skull Arena is officially available from LEGO from August 1st, 2018.  However, this set is already available in most LEGO brand stores and in LEGOLAND Germany.  And that&#8217;s where my son and I bought it last Saturday.  For a recommended retail price of 19.99 euros, we received 198 LEGO bricks and an entertaining assembly pass.  More on that in the following review.</p>
<h3>packaging and content</h3>
<p>As is usual with LEGO Minecraft sets, the parts and the building instructions are packed in a sturdy box.  However, this box is only just over half filled with two bags and the building instructions.</p>

(Photo: PROMOBRICKS)</p>
<p>After opening the two bags and briefly sorting the 198 parts, all the parts are neatly arranged on the table.  If you want to follow the instructions strictly, you can of course build bag number 1 first and then bag number 2.  The first bag contains the minifigures and the main part of the arena/island, the second bag only contains the skull.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload wp-image-65593 size-full" src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1655859890_774_LEGO-Minecraft-21145-The-Skull-Arena-Review.jpg" alt="LEGO Minecraft 21145 The Skull Arena Review" width="750" height="478"  data-/>All 198 parts neatly sorted.  (Photo: PROMOBRICKS)</p>
<h3>In a nutshell: assembly</h3>
<p>The 198 parts are put together quite quickly in a total of 57 construction steps.  Typically, the minifigures with accessories come first, followed by the arena and the skull.  You will usually look in vain for special building techniques in LEGO Minecraft sets.  This is also the case here, although this set almost only consists of stones, tiles and slabs anyway.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload wp-image-65594 size-full" src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1655859890_136_LEGO-Minecraft-21145-The-Skull-Arena-Review.jpg" alt="LEGO Minecraft 21145 The Skull Arena Review" width="750" height="469"  data-/>The set&#8217;s two LEGO Minecraft minifigures.

<p>What I find most interesting is the white skull with its red (glowing) eyes and golden crown.  In addition to the golden apple, the sword and the axe, the set also includes 16 golden LEGO elements, all of which are used for the crown.</p>
<p>In addition, the skull also offers a shooter function, which can be operated on the back.  Then the green slime cannon on the front is shot.</p>

(Photo: PROMOBRICKS)</p>
<p>Due to the good sorting before building, the small LEGO Minecraft set was assembled by children&#8217;s hands after about 20 minutes.  Many thanks to my son, who actively supported me here.</p>
<h3>Preview of more LEGO Minecraft sets</h3>
<p>At the end of the building instructions you will find the illustrations of the other LEGO Minecraft sets, which are available directly from LEGO from today.  There is also a nice overview of the expansion options for the latest LEGO Minecraft sets.  Here it becomes clear that the three new sets can easily be added to existing LEGO Minecraft islands.</p>

<h3>My conclusion</h3>
<p>LEGO Minecraft is a topic that keeps bringing us new sets.  Not in the same quantities as LEGO Star Wars, of course, but something new comes out of the series almost every six months.  And if kids are to be believed these days, Minecraft is still pretty hot.  Suitable for the actual target group: children and young people between the ages of seven and 14.  This set is either a nice introduction to the Minecraft world or a nice extension for the existing sets.  The Skull Arena is not only a colorful set because of the orange lava, the skull is also a real eye-catcher.  With a stone price of exactly ten cents, this set is almost up to the current standard and will certainly not only please the die-hard Minecraft fan.</p>
<p>We still had a lot of fun with the “players” and the “killer bunny” after the set-up.  Even the current set is still being used well.  Exactly how it should be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>hey,</p>
<p>Since we are making plaster masks at school right now, I have a few questions if anyone here has any experience with this. </p>
<p>Such a plaster mask is of course made on the face.  But now I&#8217;m wondering how it is&#8230; of course you do it in such a way that the person can still breathe.  But don&#8217;t talk and close your eyes all the time?</p>
<p>My questions:</p>
<p>1. Sometimes I&#8217;m a bit excited&#8230; and that&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t keep my eyes open all the time xD Sure, it might be different in the mornings at school, but still.  What if you opened your eyes?  Would anything happen there?  Would that be bad?  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f62e.png" alt="😮" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t know my way around that well <img src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1655857209_209_Plaster-Masks-God-the-World-Terraconia.png" class="smiley" alt=":/" height="23"  title="unsure"/></p>
<p>2. How long does something have to stay on it?  So for most of them it took about 40 minutes&#8230; (I also made the mask for one xD) But does it really take about that long or longer?  Or even..shorter?</p>
<p>3. When can the mask be removed?  We were told that if it gets warm we can make faces under the mask and then take it off after a little while&#8230; but depending on where you started it probably gets warm in different places at different times, right?</p>
<p>4. And with that the last question:<br />How does that feel roughly?  Is it possible to test in advance with any means how that is?</p>
<p>I look forward to your answers <img src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Plaster-Masks-God-the-World-Terraconia.png" class="smiley" alt="^^" height="23"  title="grin"/></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="entry-meta">  By: tech capital December 25, 2019</p>
<p>Despite being over 10 years old, the Minecraft game is still being developed and updated.  While the content updates for many games are released with so-called DLCs, content updates for Minecraft are and have always been free!</p>
<p><strong>In our article we show you the most important innovations of version 1.15 and 1.15.1!<br /></strong></p>
<h2>There is finally <strong>bees!</strong></h2>
<p>With the <strong>new version </strong>have now become official <strong>bees </strong>as <strong>new animals</strong> added to the game. <strong>You can</strong> similar to the other animals in Minecraft as well <strong>multiply </strong>or. <strong>breed</strong>.</p>
<p>Along with the bees also has the new <strong>Bee Nest Block</strong> get into the game.  In this<strong> live the bees</strong> and <strong>sweep </strong>again and again <strong>return </strong>to this. <br />Of the <strong>Beehive Block works the same way</strong>.  The only difference is that the player den <strong>beehive </strong>even <strong>manufacture </strong>can the <strong>bee nest </strong>only natural though <strong>generated </strong>can be.</p>
<p>A bee in the game Minecraft including the associated bee nest in the background!</p>
<p>These bee nests and associated bees are naturally grown in <strong>three biomes</strong> generated.  The <strong>&#8220;flower forests&#8221;</strong>the <strong>&#8220;levels&#8221;</strong> and the <strong>&#8220;Sunflower Plains&#8221;</strong>.  Unlike most other animals in Minecraft, which tend to be peaceful towards the player, bees can also attack the player.  They always attack in a swarm, regardless of how many bees you have attacked.</p>
<p>The largest <strong>special feature </strong>here is that the <strong>bee </strong>after the sting of one <strong>player dies after a short time</strong>.  The sting of a bee in Minecraft acts like poisoning and gradually deducts some life points from the player.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1655851283_47_Minecraft-versions-115-and-1151.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4191" width="500" height="265"  />Two aggressive bees towards the player, which can be recognized by their red eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Together with the bees there are the following new blocks and items:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>bee nest</li>
<li>beehive</li>
<li>honey bottles</li>
<li>honeycomb</li>
<li>Bee Spawn Egg</li>
<li>honey block</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other minor changes</h2>
<p><strong>Next to </strong>the new <strong>bees </strong>there are still <strong>some minor changes</strong> at the game, which with <strong>Version 1.15</strong> have been introduced.  We show you the most important ones here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Villagers lying in a bed can now be &#8220;awakened&#8221; or removed from the bed by right-clicking on the corresponding bed.</li>
<li>Slightly changed the texture of unemployed villagers.</li>
<li>Bells will now ring if activated by a redstone signal.</li>
<li>Campfires can now be extinguished with a shovel.</li>
<li>Composters have a new crafting recipe.</li>
<li>Iron Golems now have a damage model and can be repaired with iron.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s it!  We hope you enjoyed the article!  For more articles on exciting topics, you can also visit our Tech Capital main page!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p class="meta hidden-xs">    01/28/14 News, Videos Bohn comments</p>
<p class="meta visible-xs">    01/28/14</p>
<p class="lead">A Minecraft fan set out about three years ago to find the far end of the block world.  He is driven by a statement made at the time by Markus &#8220;Notch&#8221; Persson, the inventor of the game.  Has he already reached the end?</p>
<h3>Minecraft&#8217;s Far Lands</h3>
<p>In January 2012, the PC version of Minecraft (German edition) saw the light of day.  The game hit like a bomb and the success continues to this day.  One reason for the popularity in the community is the apparent infinity of the game world.  Blocks as far as the eye can see.  But it&#8217;s not as endless as the virtual world seems.  This was also confirmed by Notch, who explained in a blog post in early March 2011 that the Minecraft world is coming to an end.  He called the areas &#8220;Far lands&#8221;.  If someone finds these areas, the entire game slows down and wild formations and landscape features appear that are not found anywhere else.  Notch added that while the state of the ending could be fixed, he liked the idea of ​​an almost unreachable and mysterious world far away.  So he wants to keep it that way.  And by noting that it&#8217;s almost impossible for players to reach the ending, one fan came up with a very special idea.  He wants to see the map &#8220;disintegrating&#8221; at the end of a game world with his own eyes!</p>
<h3>The never-ending Minecraft journey</h3>
<p>As a result, player Kurt J. Mac set out on March 28, 2011 to scour the endless expanses of the block world and finally to reach the goal of all goals: the actual end!  The calculation error in the game is described in the Minecraft Wiki, which creates the previously unexplored ending.  It states that the distance from the center of a map to the edge is 12,520,820 meters on the scale referenced in a Minecraft generated world.  The wiki also calculated that it takes around 800 to 900 hours to finish.</p>
<p>Although the far lands problem was removed in beta version 1.8, those who are still playing with the old version can still find these areas today.  In theory, of course.  Because so far only one person came up with the idea of ​​actually wanting to find the end.  Mac is still playing in Minecraft Beta Version 1.7.3 today.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
     &#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
     &#13;</p>
<p>According to Mac, he has already come across some mysterious things that caused image errors and are apparently solved by the handling.  Are these the first signs that he is getting closer to his goal?  If you want to be there when Kurt J. Mac reaches his long-awaited end, be sure to check farlandorbust.com regularly.  Click here to go directly to his YouTube channel!  Of course we watched the current episode of &#8220;Minecraft Far Lands or Bust&#8221;, which was published just yesterday, and included it here.  The gamer is on the move with his virtual companion &#8220;Wolfie&#8221;, a loyal dog who is always at his side;  ).  Check it out and be a part of Mac&#8217;s great adventure.</p>

<p><h3>About the author: Bohn</h3>
<p>							I&#8217;m Ralf, also known as &#8220;bohncraft&#8221; in Minecraft.  Minecraft is my adult Lego.  Here I can let off steam and forget everything else.  Because the game fascinates me so much, I started this magazine in early 2012.							</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Are there mods for PS4, Switch and Xbox One?</h2>
<p>The creative construction kit by Markus &#8220;Notch&#8221; Persson (who hasn&#8217;t been involved in development for a long time) is now more than nine years old and still receives regular updates from the developers.  The modding community doesn&#8217;t think about dedicating itself to another game either, and is tackling the most diverse aspects of the sandbox: from new skins and interface improvements to entire content packages and complex physics effects, they leave no stone untouched. </p>
<p>These mods are essentially files that you download and add to your game, with some being easier to install than others.  To save you a lot of searching and tinkering, you can use curated Minecraft mod packs.  This means you don&#8217;t have to install each mod individually and you can also be sure that the different mods also harmonize with each other.  That is not always the case.  For this reason, you should always make a note of which additional files are slumbering on your hard drive so that you know where the problem might lie, just in case.  We can tell you from our own experience that otherwise it is damn tricky to localize the source of the error.  Also, always take a closer look at the source of your Minecraft mod, as there are viruses and malware slingers to be found here (as everywhere else on the internet). </p>
<p>Things are a little different on consoles, of course.  You can&#8217;t catch any viruses here and you don&#8217;t have to expect incompatibility between individual mods.  But the offer is also significantly smaller &#8211; and in most cases not even free of charge.  Rather, you have to search the stores of your respective Daddelkiste for extensions and add-ons, for which a small amount is due in most cases.  Basically, these are less mods than additional content professionally programmed by the developers.  Unfortunately, there will never be a mod variety on consoles like on the PC. </p>
<p>There is by no means a lack of high-quality Minecraft mods, but there is a lack of an overview.  But that&#8217;s what this article is for.</p>
<h2>The best Minecraft mods to download</h2>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve finally left the gray theory behind us and you know how to install mods, all you have to do is decide which ones are eligible.  Therefore, below you will find a selection of the most useful, the prettiest and generally those modifications that you should have tried out.  Have fun with it. </p>
<p><strong>Hyper HD Realism</strong>
</p>
<p>A look at the screenshot below should actually be reason enough to give the skiddion mod a chance.  Hyper HD Realism is, as the name implies, a texture pack that really revs up the graphics of the old brick adventure.  The lighting looks beautiful, as does the water.  A must-have for any of you interested in graphical improvements. </p>
<p><img alt="" class="content_image" height="342" loading="lazy" src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1655833972_809_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png"  width="608"/></p>
<p><strong>Journey map</strong></p>
<p>Like many of the mods listed here, Journey Map has been available for some time and is constantly being improved.  It allows you to track your progress on a useful grid map.  As you explore, you&#8217;ll have access to an additional minimap, as well as a detailed map noting points of interest.  This makes exploring the game world much easier.  In addition, Journey Map is extremely well optimized and extremely stable.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="content_image" height="520" loading="lazy" src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1655833973_968_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png"  width="690"/></p>
<p><strong>Terra Firm Craft</strong></p>
<p>Terra Firma Craft says it&#8217;s making Minecraft the &#8220;survival adventure it was always meant to be.&#8221;  However, behind this confident claim there is a lot of truth and a far more intense gaming experience.  You fight your way through the stone, cast iron and iron epochs one after the other, gradually getting better equipment at your disposal.  If you have to make do with primitive tools at the beginning and do unexciting things with them (there are more than enough trees to cut down), you can get everything out of the powerful forging system in the Iron Age. </p>
<p><img alt="" class="content_image" height="387" loading="lazy" src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1655833973_336_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png"  width="690"/></p>
<p><strong>Visible armor slots</strong></p>
<p>Some of the best Minecraft mods deal with seemingly small quality-of-life improvements.  Their effects are often huge and can make your everyday life much more comfortable thanks to numerous comfort functions.  Visible Armor Slots is a perfect example of such an unassuming mod with great utility.  This adds a custom armor tab to many menus, so you don&#8217;t have to constantly switch between menus.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="content_image" height="383" loading="lazy" src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1655833973_637_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png"  width="690"/></p>
<p><strong>Pam&#8217;s Harvest Craft</strong></p>
<p>With the installation of this mod you spice up the food selection in Minecraft.  Since the original release, over 275 treats and recipes have been added, including crops to harvest and transplant, fruit trees and more.  You can also craft cooking items and use them to conjure up tasty dishes from the fresh ingredients. </p>
<p><img alt="" class="content_image" height="544" loading="lazy" src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.jpg"  width="689"/></p>
<p><strong>Tough as Nails</strong></p>
<p>For the hardcore gamers among you.  Tough as Nails adds a hunger, thirst, and body temperature mechanic to the main game.  You have to keep a constant eye on each of them, which makes Minecraft almost a survival game.  Here your systemic skills and the efficient use of the inventory will be put to the test.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="content_image" height="388" loading="lazy" src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1655833974_623_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png"  width="690"/></p>
<p><strong>Just Enough Information</strong></p>
<p>Just Enough Information is a kind of in-game reference book that you can browse through at any time to find out what materials you need for a crafting recipe.  This saves an enormous amount of time and makes it easier to plan long-term what to keep an eye out for on your next foray into the world. </p>
<p><img alt="" class="content_image" height="391" loading="lazy" src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1655833974_59_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png"  width="690"/></p>
<p><strong>Hooked</strong></p>
<p>What&#8217;s cooler than a grappling hook?  Hooked adds just one to Minecraft, with the help of which you can move much faster and experience a whole new level of agility.  The mod itself is extremely small, but its implications for gameplay are enormous.  A must-download for everyone who is fed up with struggling to climb mountains and similar structures.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="content_image" height="388" loading="lazy" src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1655833974_151_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png"  width="690"/></p>
<p><strong>The Aether II</strong></p>
<p>The sequel to the popular Aether mod continues what the prequel started and throws you into a &#8220;hostile paradise in the middle of the clouds&#8221;.  You get a fascinating world, mythical creatures, mysterious buildings and impressive landscapes.  It&#8217;s worth it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Aether II - Highlands: Intro preview" width="1140" height="641" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XmSj9xFkqug?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
</iframe></p>
<p><strong>Advanced Rocketry</strong></p>
<p>A later compensation for the missed childhood dream of becoming an astronaut: With Advanced Rocketry you can craft space shuttles and (much cooler) even launch them.  You even have the opportunity to develop your own space program, build space stations and explore space.  An adorably imaginative mod that literally takes Minecraft to new heights. </p>
<p><img alt="" class="content_image" height="365" loading="lazy" src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1655833975_39_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png"  width="690"/></p>
<p><strong>Quark</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a strange, offbeat gaming experience, there are more than enough mods out there that really go against the grain of Minecraft.  Quark is also keen to give you a huge variety, while staying as close to the original vanilla experience as possible.  The devil is in the details: Quark offers you things like wooden chests, ship sails and everything in between.  The modification adds a whole new level of detail to almost every aspect, which subtly expands the existing possibilities of the main game many times over. </p>
<p><img alt="" class="content_image" height="365" loading="lazy" src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1655833975_927_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png"  width="690"/></p>
<p><strong>Chisel and Bits</strong></p>
<p>Minecraft&#8217;s blocky look may have originally been born out of pragmatic necessity, but it now accounts for a not inconsiderable iconic charm of the game.  Even so, a world thrown together from blocks can quickly seem a bit uniform.  This is where Chisel and Bits comes in, a mod that allows you to create much more detailed blocks using different chisels.  You have various tools at your disposal to give the architect in you a little outlet. </p>
<p><img alt="" class="content_image" height="453" loading="lazy" src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1655833975_539_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png"  width="690"/></p>
<p><strong>Cooking for Blockheads</strong></p>
<p>Cooking is a hell of a lot of fun in Minecraft, even if you&#8217;re constantly chasing missing ingredients.  Cooking for Blockheads tightens the entire mechanics properly, adding a cookbook to the game that only shows recipes whose ingredients you currently have available.  The mod is a great complement to Pam&#8217;s Harvest Craft and greatly expands the way you use food in the game.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="content_image" height="380" loading="lazy" src="https://minecraft101.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1655833975_307_The-best-Minecraft-mods-and-how-to-install-them.png"  width="690"/></p>
<p><strong>animania</strong></p>
<p>Animania adds a far greater variety of animals to Minecraft.  You will find more breeds, genders, behaviors and of course new species here.  If you feed your pets regularly, they will give you some resources as a thank you.  However, this is not quite as easy as it may sound at first, since every four-legged friend has its own personality. </p>
<p><iframe title="Animania Mod Spotlight #1" width="1140" height="641" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lx9HT7688xE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you create a new world in Minecraft, it is randomly generated.  So that you can invite your friends into your world, start a new game in the same environment or simply show other players your block world, you use the unique starting value, the seed.

<p>If you play in survival mode on one of the higher difficulty levels, it will make your life a lot easier if you can find a lot of degradable materials right at the spawn point or a village with hard-working residents without having to search the area for hours.</p>
<p>Of course you can now generate a new world again and again until you have an ideal entry point, or you can use the experience of other Minecrafters and look at their worlds.  Abundant resources, a flying island, shipwrecks and temples right under your nose: here are some of the best worlds in Minecraft.</p>
<h3>Golden times</h3>
<p style="font-size:140%" align="center"><strong>Seed: -139003</strong></p>
<p>At first glance, the starting point seems quite unspectacular and you end up in the middle of an apparently desolate desert landscape.  But right in front of you you will find a temple worth looting.</p>
<p>Go through the entrance and dig a hole in the middle.  But be careful not to dig right under the blue block in the middle, otherwise you will inevitably end up on a pressure plate that will explode TNT blocks shortly afterwards.  Dig one block ahead and you will end up in a treasure chamber with four chests that will give you lots of gold, diamonds, emeralds.  a golden apple, bones and even a diamond horse gear.  That&#8217;s a good start.  Visit Minecraft Seed HQ for more info</p>
<h3>Everything you need to survive</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%" align="center"><strong>Seed: -193148232</strong></p>
<p>You land right on the border between a vast desert and tree landscape.  In both areas you will find a large settlement and even a harbor after a short walk.  Everything you need at the beginning, safe accommodation, workbenches, butchers, weapon smiths or farmers as well as many different materials is available in the immediate vicinity.</p>
<h3>A flying island</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone fullwidthelement size-full lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49693735742_a445b93f1a_b.jpg"></p>
<p style="font-size:140%" align="center"><strong>Seed: 109774369</strong></p>
<p>How about building a gigantic monument above the clouds?  As a basis you use the large island that you see floating in front of your eyes right after the start.</p>
<p>In creative mode you can get started right away and, for example, build a gigantic tower that can be seen from afar.  In survival mode you need a way to the clouds, so gather materials and build a stairway to the sky.</p>
<h3>Ship Ahoy</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone fullwidthelement size-full lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49692892788_5179d5e235_b.jpg"></p>
<p style="font-size:140%" align="center"><strong>Seed: -1184384676</strong></p>
<p>Right at your spawn point you will see a mighty shipwreck stranded on an island just waiting to be explored and plundered.</p>
<p>In the chests you will find, for example, paper, quills and a treasure map.  You can then settle down and build your own home in the almost Caribbean environment of several smaller islands.  In the Minecraft &amp; Chill video you can see even more interesting seeds for Minecraft.</p>
<h3>underwater world</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone fullwidthelement size-full lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49693434381_21f3349433_b.jpg"></p>
<p style="font-size:140%" align="center"><strong>Seed: 2104241268</strong></p>
<p>If you want to let your creativity run free under water, then you will find exactly the right area with the seed for a wide underwater world.  Immediately after the start, you simply jump into the pixel water and there you will find everything that frolics in the wet water in Minecraft.  You can find these and many other fantastic worlds in the extensive list of VG24/7.</p>
<h3>Luxurious life</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone fullwidthelement size-full lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49692890523_5d375486f7_b.jpg"></p>
<p style="font-size:140%" align="center"><strong>Seed: 2033394339</strong></p>
<p>Well, the huge building on the mountain does look a bit spooky, but you can make yourself comfortable here without first having to carry and build lots of materials.  In the mega villa you will find the ideal place for a comfortable and luxurious headquarters over several floors.  The property is populated by a few loitering NPCs and the search for chests is really worthwhile.  You can find this and other exciting seeds at Pro Game Guides, for example.</p>
